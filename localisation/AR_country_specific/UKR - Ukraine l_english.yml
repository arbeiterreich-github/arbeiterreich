### Ideas ###
 language_issue: "Issue of the Russian Language"
 language_issue_desc: "The centuries-long Russian dominance of Ukraine and suppression of the Ukrainian language has produced a sizeable Russian-speaking minority, or perhaps even majority, in Ukraine. With independence, the Ukrainian language has been reinvigorated, much to the chagrin of numerous Russo-Ukrainians, many of whom resist the Ukrainian government or even desire a return to Russian rule."
 Hetman_army: "Hetman's Army"
 Hetman_army_desc: "The Hetman of Ukraine, general Pavlo Skoropadskyi, supported by Germany, undermined Austrian influence in Ukraine following the 1927 Austrian Ausgleich renegotiations. The political strife between the military, dominated by the Hetman, and the Ukrainian Rada, headed by the king, has left Ukraine's military in such disarray that even personal reconciliation between the Hetman and Rada would seem to be insufficient; the Ukrainian military is in dire need of reform."

 UKR_New_Agriculture_desc: "With new infrastructure and technological advancement, Ukraine's agricultural output, already substantial, has grown to become one of the largest in Europe.

### Events ###

### Focuses ###

 UKR_Our_Future: "Our Future"
 UKR_Our_Future_desc: "The agricultural crisis has almost shattered the Ukrainian economy and stability in the country. The King barely controls the country, those loyal to the Hetman peasants want land reforms, pro-Russian forces and Nationalists demand radical measures and the Syndicalists mobilise their supporters all over the country..."

 UKR_Invite_Shumsky: "Invite Shumsky Into Government"
 UKR_Invite_Shumsky_desc: "Oleksander Shumsky, a well-known but controversial Ukrainian social-democrat, proposes the populist idea, very popular among the peasants, of the reorganisation of our agriculture. We have to admit that this proposition seems like it can help Ukraine in her time of crisis. Maybe we should invite him into government to implement these reforms?"
 UKR_Popular_Front: "The Popular Front"
 UKR_Popular_Front_desc: "Though we have given Shumsky free reign to reorganise the economy, many of our legislators in the Rada have prevented any attempt by Shumsky to reduce the power of the Kulak landlords. That's why Shumsky has announced a creation of the 'Popular Front', which will unite left members of the Supreme Rada and give him enough authority to change the laws."
 UKR_Language_Issue: "Solve The Language Issue"
 UKR_Language_Issue_desc: "The Russian language is widespread in Ukraine and the native tongue of many of our citizens, but it has never been an official state language. If we grant Russian a formal role in the Ukrainian state, it will allow us to gain popularity among pro-Russian citizens and solve one of the divisive issues our nation faces."
 UKR_Exp_Kulaks: "Expropriate Kulak Holdings"
 UKR_Exp_Kulaks_desc: "'Kulaks' or 'Kurkuls' is a category of relatively affluent farmers who are able to hire a lot of the poorest peasants and thus earn an enormous amount of money. Since they are hated by the majority of the peasants, we can easily expropriate they lands and divide them between the poorest peasants in the country."
 UKR_Tax_Kulaks: "Increase Kulak Taxation"
 UKR_Tax_Kulaks_desc: "'Kulaks' or 'Kurkuls' is a category of relatively affluent farmers who are able to hire a lot of the poorest peasants and thus earn an enormous amount of money. Since they are the only group of the farmers that are still able to fulfil our consumer needs, it would be wise to let them have their lands, but to impose an additional tax on them."
 UKR_Coll_Prog: "Collectivisation"
 UKR_Coll_Prog_desc: "After the latest agricultural crisis among the 'Kulaks', we have many new poor peasants all over Ukraine. Shumsky proposes that they can work on new collective farms and produce goods for the state, which will provide them with farming tools and pay them a reasonable salary. This should hopefully, through pooling of resources, boost our total output."
 UKR_Fate_Monarchy: "The Fate of the Monarchy"
 UKR_Fate_Monarchy_desc: "King Vasyl has become somewhat of a laughing stock to the Ukrainian people. By handing major powers to Shumsky and seeing more issues solved in months than the King himself had resolved in years he has only highlighted his own irrelevance. A former Austrian puppet king with no Austrian backing, his position is being openly debated by Popular Front members."
 UKR_Syn_Rev: "A Red Hetman"
 UKR_Syn_Rev_desc: "As the great Hetman Bogdan Khmelnitsky, who once liberated people on both banks of the Dnieper from the Polish yoke, once did; Oleksander Shumsky and the Popular Front deposed the King, the Hetman, and purged the Rada of all elements not willing to embrace the new reality. Finally the people of Ukraine are ready to build new society, one both proud and free!"
 UKR_Friendship_Nations: "Friendship of Nations"
 UKR_Friendship_Nations_desc: "The capitalists did their best to divide the people of Ukraine, imposing chauvinism and intolerance on the national minorities of our country. But new leadership with Shumsky is ready to fight this deception and will encourage a policy of friendship with people from all nations. That's how the people of Ukraine will cooperate for a better future!"
 UKR_Aid_Workers: "Liberate Industries To The Workers"
 UKR_Aid_Workers_desc: "The workers have Ukraine have always received a raw deal under the tyrannical Kingdom. But now with Oleksander Shumsky heading up a new popular socialist government he can begin implementing one of his more ambitious ideas of liberating industries to the workers that toil in them."
 UKR_Cheap_Housing: "Communal Housing"
 UKR_Cheap_Housing_desc: "Our engineers have designed a new type of low-cost, concrete-panelled three to five-storied apartment building developed, at the request of our leader Oleksander Shumsky. Mass production of these structures should finally solve the housing problem in the rapidly expanding Ukrainian cities and will provide more employment and accommodation to the masses."
 UKR_Remove_Shumsky: "Purge the Leftists"
 UKR_Remove_Shumsky_desc: "The recent denigration of the royal position has demonstrated that Shumsky and his Popular Front partners are an unacceptable threat to King and Country. We will remove them from all of their offices in a major purge with the Hetman's backing. Once done, we will have to abolish their most radical laws and start to re-calibrate our economy."

 UKR_Broad_Coalition: "Coalition With The Nationalists"
 UKR_Broad_Coalition_desc: "Realising the scale of the Syndicalist threat, Hetman Skoropadskyi decided to strike a bargain with the pro-Russian 'ViN' and nationalist 'OUN'. Both parties will get freedom of action in regions where they are especially popular, but in return they will support Skoropadskyi's regime and the King in the Rada through a 'confidence and supply' agreement."
 UKR_Rightist_Government: "Implement Administrative Reforms"
 UKR_Rightist_Government_desc: "Members of 'Faith and Nation' and 'Organisation of the Ukrainian Nationalists' have begun to replace Hetman-period officials in the regions en-masse, somewhat upsetting the balance of the Rada. Surprisingly, this has had a positive effect on our economy because eager new local governments are keen to solve the problems afflicting their own towns. The first steps of reform are under way."
 UKR_ViN_Russophiles: "ViN's Land Reform"
 UKR_ViN_Russophiles_desc: "It seems that Mikhail Bulgakov, with the help of 'ViN', has finally found a method by which the land question can be resolved amicably. The Ukrainian Church, which is a part of the Russian Orthodox Church, will sell vast swathes of mostly unoccupied lands to the peasants at a discount, but Orthodoxy will be recognised as the formal state religion in Ukraine."
 UKR_OUN_Nationalists: "Requisition Polish Farms"
 UKR_OUN_Nationalists_desc: "A number of Polish landlords control land in Western and Central Ukraine for historical reasons. Since Poland is decidedly weak now, we can easily confiscate their estates, expel these Poles, and redistribute their lands among the Ukrainian peasants. This should also coincidentally appeal to nationalist supporters of both stripes that generally detest the Polish minority."
 UKR_Abolish_Law: "Recognise Russian"
 UKR_Abolish_Law_desc: "One of the biggest problems which exists in Ukraine is the language question. De-facto, the Russian language is used by a majority of the population, but its usage is prohibited by the state institutions. 'ViN' has always opposed this prohibition and thus it is with great pleasure that Mikhail Bulgakov is now able to abolish this language law."
 UKR_Prosvita_Mov: "Support The Prosvita Movement"
 UKR_Prosvita_Mov_desc: "Unfortunately, a sizeable percentage of our population use the Russian language despite the fact that the government doesn't recognise it at a state level for use in national institutions. To combat this, 'OUN' has proposed to invest in a 'Prosvita' ('Education') movement. The aim of 'Prosvita' is to spread Ukrainian language and culture throughout the country, as well as abroad."
 UKR_Free_Trade: "Establish The Eastern Free Trade Area"
 UKR_Free_Trade_desc: "The free trade area with Ukraine has shown its benefits. The borderlands which have been deserted since the Weltkrieg are full of collieries and ironworks now. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest level since 1918. This is a great example of the successes brought by Russo-Ukrainian cooperation!"
 UKR_Resettlement: "Resettle The Peasants"
 UKR_Resettlement_desc: "The Ukrainian nation is still divided, even though Ukraine itself has been an independent country for almost 20 years. We should address this situation by resettling peasants from Western Ukraine to the East, where they will become workers in the Donbass industrial region. This also will also serve to bring Ukrainian ideas and traditions into this unfriendly 'ViN' region."
 UKR_Crisis_Coalition: "The Coalition Splits!"
 UKR_Crisis_Coalition_desc: "Though the Syndicalist threat has mostly melted away due to government reforms, 'ViN' and 'OUN' have gained too much popularity among the citizens of Ukraine and their followers are inadvertently violently splitting our country apart with their nationalistic fervour. This situation cannot continue as the situation in Europe is quickly deteriorating."

 UKR_Dissolve_Rada: "Dissolve the Rada"
 UKR_Dissolve_Rada_desc: "Our Supreme Rada (Parliament) has always been too left and never really supported Skoropadskyi's policies as Hetman. The King has been shaken out of his legislative stupor to grant Skoropadskyi the authority to dissolve the Rada and form instead a loyal State Senate, stacked primarily with regime puppets and useful officials from different Ukrainian regions."
 UKR_Skoropadsky_Policy: "Promote Ukrainian Unity"
 UKR_Skoropadsky_Policy_desc: "The relations between the Russians and the Ukrainians in Ukraine are good enough, but various powers try to depict them as an eternal struggle between the West and the East. We must stop this chauvinistic propaganda, but our aim is also to show that despite the common past and good relations with Russia, we are independent now and will always be."
 UKR_Army_Reforms: "A Professional Army"
 UKR_Army_Reforms_desc: "It is obvious that the Ukrainian army is incomparable to the Russian and German behemoths, and yet it is still stronger than any neighbouring army. That's why Skoropadskyi has proposed re-orientating our army towards a smaller professional force. It will help us maintain our security, and will allow us to reduce our costly defence spending."
 UKR_Peasant_State: "A Peasant State"
 UKR_Peasant_State_desc: "Our peasants have always played a significant role in the country and its economy. With extra money available from our reduced military spending, we can reduce taxes for the poor until our agriculture recovers from Black Monday and we will become the breadbasket of Europe once again."
 UKR_Prohibit_Syndicalism: "Prohibit Syndicalism"
 UKR_Prohibit_Syndicalism_desc: "We have reached an understanding with the pro-Russian circles, pacified the various Ukrainian movements and helped make the peasantry loyal to us. Now we have to deal with the Syndicalists. Our mass media will start a massive propaganda campaign, showing the Syndies as a malignant tumour on Slavdom. Our efforts will eventually enable us to ban many notorious left parties."
 UKR_Federalisation: "Federalisation"
 UKR_Federalisation_desc: "The Syndicalists, Nationalists and the Russophiles have all tried to impose their ideas on the whole country. This has demonstrated the flaws of the centralised approach of the Hetmanate. If we give our regions more autonomy and weaken the Supreme Rada, we will be able to stop regional debates becoming flashpoints on the national stage to ensure political chaos remains a thing of the past."

 UKR_New_Heir: "The Succession Question"
 UKR_New_Heir_desc: "King Vasyl, as vigorous in his production of heirs as in running the country, has left the royal succession up for debate. There are only two realistic contenders, Leo Stefan Habsburg or Danylo Skoropadskyi. Neither are completely ideal but this question must be solved sooner rather than later."
 UKR_Pereyaslav_treaty: "The Treaty of Pereyaslav"
 UKR_Pereyaslav_treaty_desc: "With Russian nationalists in charge of the Ukrainian government, the option is now available for us to petition the Russian government for reintegration back into Mother Russia. There is no guarantee that they would risk incurring Germany's wrath by accepting us however."
 UKR_OUN_Embargo: "Embargo Germany"
 UKR_OUN_Embargo_desc: "With Ukrainian nationalists dominating the government, the time has come to put the Ukrainian people first - by taking a serious gamble. For too long our nation's economy and agricultural sector has been geared towards serving the Germany people at our own expense. This will end. Protectionism is the only way we can assert ourselves."
 UKR_Grand_Coronation: "A Grand Coronation"
 UKR_Grand_Coronation_desc: "With the Kingdom finally becoming stable once more it has been proposed that a second and grand coronation inside Saint Sophia's Cathedral be prepared. Unfortunately due to the political turmoil following Vasyl's death, [ROOT.GetSuccessorFullName] was unable to receive a proper coronation. This will be rectified at once."
 UKR_Ban_ViN: "Ban ViN"
 UKR_Ban_ViN_desc: "The so-called 'Faith and Nation' organisation is little more than a front for russophilic traitors and if they were in power they would see us annexed into the old Empire. With Dontsov assuming the mantle of government it is time to permanently rid ourselves of these treacherous scum."
 UKR_Ban_OUN: "Ban The OUN"
 UKR_Ban_OUN_desc: "The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists, often referred to as the OUN, has become something of a problem in recent years. With its fervent anti-German rhetoric, they could become a dangerous enemy and the most simplest way to deal with them is ban them and crack down on their operations."
 UKR_New_Scientists: "New Scientists"
 UKR_New_Scientists_desc: "The main aim of our government has always been stability. With a new atmosphere of relative calm descending on the nation our young people are moving into the sciences and many companies are investing into research. We can only support this process."
 UKR_Extend_State_Powers: "Extend The Executive Powers"
 UKR_Extend_State_Powers_desc: "The executive powers have always been a bit too weak and this allowed the left-leaning Rada to dominate state affairs. But with the new government in place it is time to extend them so as to create a greater and stronger Ukrainian state."
 UKR_Discredit_Democrats: "Discredit Moderate Republicanism"
 UKR_Discredit_Democrats_desc: "For many years the moderate republicans of Ukraine have attacked and criticised our rule for various reasons and harken back to the short-lived people's republic. Their influence must be curbed and the legacy of the UNR slandered in the minds of all Ukrainians."
 UKR_State_Companies: "State Backed Companies"
 UKR_State_Companies_desc: "As the economy begins to grow again we can begin investing in state-backed companies to further our already healthy industrial output and shield the economy from any further downward trends."
 UKR_Secret_Police: "The Bureau Of Special Investigations"
 UKR_Secret_Police_desc: "With the last few years being tumultuous at best it has been decided that a new kind of police force must be established. One that will strike from the shadows and monitor those extremists in the syndicalists who would see our state crumble."

 UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery: "Begin The Recovery"
 UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery_desc: "Social problems always provoke political instability. Lots of peasants join Syndicalist, nationalist or Russian separatist movements because of awful living conditions. If we want to save Ukraine from collapse, we should start a recovery programme and help the poorest grain-growers in Central Ukraine, providing our population with the cheap electricity they require. For this, we need cash."
 UKR_First_Loan: "Request A German Loan For Electrification"
 UKR_First_Loan_desc: "We should ask Germany for a loan, which we will be able to use for the electrification of the poorest grain-growers. By doing so we will improve their living conditions and help modernise their production methods. They must understand that the situation in Ukraine is unstable and it is important to help us, since we secure German interests in the East."
 UKR_First_TaxHike: "New Taxes For The Electrification"
 UKR_First_TaxHike_desc: "We must use our own resources and raise taxes, since there is no other way to get investment for the programme of the electrification of the villages in the Central Ukraine. We hope that our peasants will understand us."
 UKR_Electrification: "New Resource Development"
 UKR_Electrification_desc: "Our government has finally been able to electrify all the villages in Central Ukraine. As a result our peasants will be able to produce more agricultural goods and supplies. Now we also need more resources, to fuel our nation's recovery and create the tools to do it."
 UKR_Second_Loan: "Request A German Loan For Industrialisation"
 UKR_Second_Loan_desc: "We have improved the situation in Central Ukraine - it's time to do something in the Eastern part of the country. All the factories built by the Tsarist government should be modernised as fast as possible. But we need investment and technological support from our ally in Berlin!"
 UKR_Second_TaxHike: "New Taxes For The Industrialisation"
 UKR_Second_TaxHike_desc: "Electricity is available all over the Central Ukraine - now it's time to rebuild industry in the Eastern part of the country. All the factories built by the Tsarist government should be modernised as fast as possible. And that's why we have to raise taxes. Again."
 UKR_Kharkov_Industry: "Establish New Industrial Zones"
 UKR_Kharkov_Industry_desc: "Kharkov has always been one of the most populated cities in Ukraine, but we have never used this advantage in our economy. Now is a perfect time to launch the formation of a new industrial region in the Kharkov region and finally make our industry strong!"
 UKR_Revive_Agriculture: "Revive The Agricultural Sector"
 UKR_Revive_Agriculture_desc: "Our main aim was to turn Ukraine into the breadbasket of Europe and an indispensable partner to Germany and the Reichspakt. On the contrary, we became even more dependent on German goods after Black Monday and our trade deficit widened significantly. Now with much of the country electrified we can begin renewing this area of industry."
 UKR_Donbass_Industry: "Rejuvenate the Industrial Sector"
 UKR_Donbass_Industry_desc: "After a long period of political turbulence, the situation in Ukraine is more or less stable, and we have a good chance to continue reforms. Our long-term aim is to develop industry in the East of Ukraine. Thanks to the Tsarist regime, we just have to re-open old factories and modernise them a little or launch the formation of a new industrial region. The Donbass is a perfect place for such an endeavour."
 UKR_Stab_econ: "Stabilisation"
 UKR_Stab_econ_desc: "Thanks to our elaborate measures, we revived our economy and mitigated the consequences of the Black Monday for Ukraine. We can hope that our economy will soon prove itself to be competitive throughout Europe."

 UKR_army_internal_structure_review: "The Army Internal Structure Review"
 UKR_army_internal_structure_review_desc: "As 1936 rolls around, Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, on behalf of King Vasyl, sets out to conduct his yearly review of the Army’s Internal Structure. A personal project of the Hetman, Skoropadskyi has dedicated much of time and resources to grooming the developing Military Apparatus."
 UKR_doctrinal_experimentation: "Doctrinal Experimentation"
 UKR_doctrinal_experimentation_desc: "Emboldened by the rise in global tensions, the Hetman has appealed for solidification of a proper course for the army, based on newly developed warfare doctrines. For such a task, he has turned to the Top Officers’ Corps, composed of high Officers of the Independence Era - Oleksandr Udovychenko, Yevhen Konovalets and Oleksandr Zahrodskyi."
 UKR_rapid_mobility_drills: "Rapid Mobility Drills"
 UKR_rapid_mobility_drills_desc: "High Armoured Mobility is key in modern warfare. Which is why we should make sure we have an ample supply of armoured mechanical vehicles that we know how to properly utilise."
 UKR_logistical_warfare: "Logistical Warfare"
 UKR_logistical_warfare_desc: "Although our largely flat terrain is usually seen as a disadvantage, there is one key upside to it. That is, the ease of logistical supply. Taking steps to ensure we can keep continuously supplying our troops is our current chief directive."
 UKR_concentrated_firepower: "Concentrated Firepower Training"
 UKR_concentrated_firepower_desc: "There’s little more effective in warring than a punishing barrage of firepower on any given target. Effectiveness of such strategies increases even further in the event of utilising specialised artillery in divisions. Which we shall do."
 UKR_shock_artillery_fire: "Shock Artillery Fire"
 UKR_shock_artillery_fire_desc: "Sometimes, using artillery fire is necessary not so much for defeating the enemy, as much as disorganising and discombobulating it. Effective campaign of such allows the enemy to show its weakness, which is why we should invest in artillery most effective in this department."
 UKR_army_research_bureau: "Establish the Army Research Bureau"
 UKR_army_research_bureau_desc: "As we march into the future, it becomes plainly obvious that new wars will rather be won using superior technology than any long-form trench warfare or “flood-wave” tactics. As such, we should establish an Army department tasked with staying on top of any new developments in Doctrinal or Technological enhancements."
 UKR_reverse_engineer_artillery: "Reverse Engineer Foreign Artillery"
 UKR_reverse_engineer_artillery_desc: "Artillery has become more and more useful in warfare, so much so that many frontline battalions nowadays are exclusively based on punishing artillery fire. We should take note and go forth, examining the models utilised by our faithful allies in the North. Whatever we find out, we’ll be able to combine with our own designs and models."
 UKR_deploy_new_tanks: "Deploy New Tank Prototypes"
 UKR_deploy_new_tanks_desc: "Experimentation in the Tanking Department (centralised around the Kharkiv Locomotive Factory) is something that we’ve been engaging in for almost a decade now and it seems like our efforts have started to bear fruit, spearheaded by Junior Officer Ivan Cherniakhovskyi. We should take steps to deploy our prototypes on the field."

 UKR_lessons_of_the_weltkrieg_focus: "Lessons of the Weltkrieg"
 UKR_lessons_of_the_weltkrieg_focus_desc: "Emboldened by the rise in global tensions, the Hetman has appealed for solidification of a proper course for the army, based on experiences of the Weltkrieg. For such a task, he has turned to the High Officers’ Corps, composed of top Officers of the Former Russian Imperial Army - Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko, Oleksandr Hrekiv and Kostiantyn Prisovskyi."
 UKR_refurbish_odessa_military_academy: "Refurbish Odesa Military Academy"
 UKR_refurbish_odessa_military_academy_desc: "As one of the oldest Military Academies in the former Russian Empire, the Odesa Military Academy is a prime education source for the arts of war. Nevertheless, the Academy has never gotten proper oversight since our Independence. Time to change that."
 UKR_adopt_new_infantry_designs: "Adopt New Infantry Designs"
 UKR_adopt_new_infantry_designs_desc: "Inspired by our longform alliance with the Kaiserreich, as well as our other Northern allies, we should move forward and adopt the centralised infantry layout utilised in the greater Reichspakt region."
 UKR_adopt_modern_radio_technology: "Implement Army Radio Service"
 UKR_adopt_modern_radio_technology_desc: "The Army Radio Service can easily be considered one of the pillars of future warfare. Yet, the service still lacks a proper centralised structure to make its use effective. Let us implement a centralised scheme."
 UKR_expand_kyiv_officer_school: "Expand the Kyiv Officer School"
 UKR_expand_kyiv_officer_school_desc: "The Kyiv Officer Instruction School was established in 1918, during the first year of Hetman Skoropadskyi's rule (but before the coronation of King Vasyl) and since then has been a consistent source of newfangled officer graduates. We should take steps to expand it."
 UKR_entrenchment_and_fortification_training: "Entrenchment and Fortification Training"
 UKR_entrenchment_and_fortification_training_desc: "It is true that our nation’s borders are not particularly defendable. Which is all the more reason why we should focus on proper entrenchment and fortification courses. For one we should be able to defend our borders, no matter where the threat comes from."
 UKR_war_games: "War Games"
 UKR_war_games_desc: "To make sure we stay vigilant, it is in our interest to enact War Games on a regular basis. Expensive? Perhaps, but it certainly is a worthwhile endeavour, allowing us to properly stay alert."
 UKR_consolidate_the_reserve_forces: "Consolidate the Reserve Forces"
 UKR_consolidate_the_reserve_forces_desc: "Currently, our reserve forces are spread out across various departments as a consequence of the bureaucratic disease. We should take steps to rectify this misdirection and unify the reservists across a streamlined number of detachments."
 UKR_implement_48_hour_plan: "Implement the 48-Hour Plan"
 UKR_implement_48_hour_plan_desc: "Informally known as the “48-Hour Plan”, this plan exists as a contingency effort to make sure we can defend ourselves from a total onslaught in the event of a massive invasion (most likely from the East). Successful implementation would allow us to enact a total mobilisation in the nation and make sure the foreign invaders are stopped."

 UKR_aviation_board: "Establish the Ukrainian Aviation Board"
 UKR_aviation_board_desc: "The Ukrainian Aviation Department has been part of the Army Branch since the onset of its creation. It is time we established a separate overseeing board to make use of more effective planning and strategic outcomes in regards to our Air Force."
 UKR_flying_clubs: "Foster Flying Clubs"
 UKR_flying_clubs_desc: "Flying Clubs are easily one of the best investments one can make in regards to supporting one’s national Aviation Forces. A rise in utility for Military Aviation corresponds to a rise in a need for pilots. As such, we should support the creation of Aero Clubs across the various Urban centres."
 UKR_deploy_new_fighter_prototypes: "Deploy New Fighter Prototypes"
 UKR_deploy_new_fighter_prototypes_desc: "In recent years we’ve taken to developing our own Fighter designs, with some joint effort from our northern allies (primarily Germany). Our efforts have paid off, it seems. Testing has shown a very positive result. As such, we should deploy our newly developed aviation for mass production."
 UKR_commission_new_bomber_designs: "Commission Domestic Bomber Designs"
 UKR_commission_new_bomber_designs_desc: "Bombers have been shown to be very effective in disabling various elements of the war machine of any given warring nation. Whenever the next major European war comes, and it will, we must be ready. Depending on the designs utilised by our northern allies (primarily Germany) is all well and good, but it isn’t completely viable. As such, we must begin working on own designs."

### Naval Focuses ###
 UKR_naval_effort: "Review The Navy"
 UKR_naval_effort_desc: "A strong fleet is vital if we are to look beyond simply our own borders. Protecting our trade and coastlines shall require a strong naval force."
 UKR_Odessa_Naval: "Fortify The Odessa Harbour"
 UKR_Odessa_Naval_desc: "Odessa was always an important trade port for Ukraine, that's why we must be ready to defend this city with our Black Sea fleet. We should expand the harbour in Odessa."
 UKR_Crimea_Naval: "Refurbish The Port of Sevastopol"
 UKR_Crimea_Naval_desc: "When we took control over Crimea in 1918, we also got almost the whole Russian Black Sea fleet. Despite that boon, without a proper renovation of the Sevastopol naval base, we will be unable to use it properly. If we want to strengthen our role in the Black Sea region, we must do our best to rebuild the port of Sevastopol."
 UKR_flexible_navy: "The Two Seas Fleet"
 UKR_flexible_navy_desc: "Ukraine spans across two seas, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Differing conditions in both of these mean that a diverse, flexible navy should serve us the best."
 UKR_large_navy: "Naval Power Projection"
 UKR_large_navy_desc: "Only a large fleet will suit Ukraine, as without one we won't be able to control the long coastlines of the Black and Azov Seas."
 UKR_submarine_effort: "Wolves of the Euxine"
 UKR_submarine_effort_desc: "The submarine is vital to winning any war against a foe reliant upon trade. If their convoys are sunk, their men go without supplies - this will lead to an easy victory. We must ensure that the Black Sea acts for our enemies as little more than a dark watery grave."
 UKR_cruiser_effort: "Each Ship A Bulwark"
 UKR_cruiser_effort_desc: "Native dockyards in Odessa and Nikolayev are more than capable of producing large ships, such as cruisers. These will prove priceless in nearly every naval engagement."
 UKR_destroyer_effort: "Convoy Defenders"
 UKR_destroyer_effort_desc: "Our country may be able to support its people in manners of food, but other essential resources must be shipped in from the rest of the world. Destroyers will ensure that this supply is protected."
 UKR_capital_ships_effort: "Firepower Superiority"
 UKR_capital_ships_effort_desc: "There is no greater vessel than a battleship. If we develop new and powerful variants, Ukraine shall become unassailable on the Black and Azov seas."

 UKR_mikhail_bulgakov_leader_desc: "Mikhail Bulgakov, an ethnic Russian born in the Kiev governate, was for much of his life known more so for his prolific writings and literary talents rather than politics. After finding himself heading up the russophile ViN organisation, he is now in charge of the government and has made his intentions clear that the so-called 'Free State of Ukraine' is little more than a temporary fixture until the nation can be annexed into the motherland once more."

 UKR_pavlo_skoropadskyi: "Pavlo Skoropadskyi"

 UKR_dmytro_dontsov: "Dmytro Dontsov"
 UKR_dmytro_dontsov_leader_desc: "Dmytro Dontsov has been are the forefront of Ukrainian nationalism for many years and has solidified his position as the primary nationalist ideologue in Ukraine. His organisation, the OUN has become powerful during the interwar and now finally ascended to a position of leadership with his intentions of driving out both German and Russian influences as well as a general crackdown against socialist activity."

 UKR_wilhelm_franz_von_habsburg: "Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen"
 UKR_wilhelm_franz_von_habsburg_regnal: "Vasyl"
 UKR_wilhelm_franz_von_habsburg_leader_desc: "King Vasyl I von Habsburg-Lothringen is regarded by most ethnic Slavs, Russians and Ukrainians alike, to be a humiliating symbol of foreign dominance. In fact, with political polarisation growing so rapidly in Ukraine, a disdain for King Vasyl is perhaps the only commonality amongst Ukrainians. With such opposition, a stagnant economy, a dysfunctional bureaucracy, and most of all, tension with the influential Hetman, Vasyl struggles to maintain authority."

 UKR_leo_stefan_von_habsburg: "Leo Stefan von Habsburg-Lothringen"
 UKR_leo_stefan_von_habsburg_regnal: "Leo Stefan"
 UKR_leo_stefan_von_habsburg_leader_desc: "King Leo Stefan von Habsburg-Lothringen, while ethnically Austrian, has been raised in the Ukrainian culture. While to some, Leo's ascension is indicative of compromise between the Reichspakt and Ukraine, many lament the continued dominance of Ukraine by foreigners. The real compromise, these dissidents claim, was between Germany and Austria, who are now united in support for Leo. Domestically much of Leo's support comes from the powerful land-owning class who now control the Rada and who see the young king as little more than a puppet to illicit Austro-German support for their endeavours."

 UKR_danylo_skoropadskyi: "Danylo Skoropadskyi"
 UKR_danylo_skoropadskyi_regnal: "Danylo"
 UKR_danylo_skoropadskyi_leader_desc: "King Danylo Skoropadskyi, son of the famous 'Hetman', has ascended to the Ukrainian throne. With the long power-struggle between the Hetman and the monarchy finally resolved, Ukraine breathes a sign of relief. Danylo however is quite rightly seen by many as little more than a puppet king, effectively allowing his father to the bulk of rulership while he himself acts as the front-man. Perhaps after Pavlo Skoropadsky's death will the young king finally be able to assert himself but for now the young king will do just as he is told."
