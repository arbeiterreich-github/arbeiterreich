### Parties ###
 BRA_social_democrat_party: "ED"
 BRA_social_democrat_party_long: "Esquerda Democrática\n§gThe labour movement in Brazil is small and incredibly fractured among regional and ideological lines. In an attempt to improve the livelihood of Brazilians, several moderate leaders have spent the past few years attempting to organise a broad, united left front to run for the elections and show the will of the proletariat in a democratic fashion. While the aptly named Democratic Left did have presidential candidates before 1936, those were of middling importance and appeal, and could not even gather support among major unions. It would take a major shake-up in the political landscape of the labour movement as a whole to allow the broad front to gain traction, but if such a feat could be achieved, it could be a credible threat to the predatory crony capitalists who currently hold power in Brazil.§!"
 BRA_social_conservative_party: "PR"
 BRA_social_conservative_party_long: "Partido Republicano\n§gThe new political order that arose from the war between the states is one almost entirely moulded by the Republican party and its members, who led the opposition to the federal government on that occasion. While not technically a party (since it's actually more akin to a federation of parties that exist on a state level) the high ranking members of the Republicans have nation-wide notoriety and wield equally immense political power. They have held this power in Brazil for a long time, due to the powerful men that support them. Figures anywhere from industrialists to plantation owners ensure that the voting tends more often than not to be in their favour. While things may yet change, these political elites are anything if not adaptable, and will always be considering ways to regain or maintain their power.§!"
 BRA_authoritarian_democrat_party: "PPF"
 BRA_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Partido Parlamentarista Federal\n§gWhile the concept of the Military taking control of Brazil may seem unrealistic to the average Brazilian, they have always been the primary power brokers since the fall of the empire. To keep its power, a transitional military government would have to be on the prowl for dissenters, while keeping a facade of democratic representation to gain legitimacy, especially after the immense chaos that would be necessary for such a state of affairs to come to be.§!"
 BRA_paternal_autocrat_party: "PR - C"
 BRA_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Partido Republicano - Centralista\n§gWhile traditionally decentralised for decades, and even with major armed opposition against any kind of overt centralisation, a new kind of state is often purported to defend and maintain Brazil's sovereignty in the chaotic situation the world, where crisis and recession looms at every corner. Strong and bold leadership, with one man to be father of Brazil's poor and downtrodden; and to act with a firm hand against those who would do Brazil harm.§!"
 BRA_paternal_autocrat2_party: "PPB"
 BRA_paternal_autocrat2_party_long: "Partido Popular Brasileiro\n§gWhile traditionally decentralised for decades, and even with major armed opposition against any kind of overt centralisation, a new kind of state is often purported to defend and maintain Brazil's sovereignty in the chaotic situation the world, where crisis and recession looms at every corner. Strong and bold leadership, with one man to be father of Brazil's poor and downtrodden; and to act with a firm hand against those who would do Brazil harm. Such a man has arisen now in Getúlio Vargas, and a new kind of state is about to make its mark in Brazil.§!"
 BRA_national_populist_party: "AIB"
 BRA_national_populist_party_long: "Ação Integralista Brasileira\n§gIntegralism is a relatively young ideology in Brazil, imported mostly by Portuguese immigrants after the War of '27. A highly reactionary and nationalistic ideology, its Brazilian form is quite peculiar, for it preaches that the character of the nation is both Catholic and racially diverse, and as such faith and unity are Brazil's strength. It abhors democracy on principle, seeing it as weak, and the Republic as the reason for Brazil's fall from grace. While not openly monarchical at first, few doubt this aspect of their beliefs, considering the constant anti-republican rhetoric spouted by propaganda newspapers. The AIB, by far the most important integralist movement, is actually quite homogenous in nature, with especially large portions of its electorate being of colour, and even some 'revolutionary republicans' among its ranks. Most of its core leadership, influenced by Europe's political events, feel that a restoration of the Empire is the only way to restore Brazil's glory.§!"
 BRA_social_liberal_party: "PL"
 BRA_social_liberal_party_long: "Partido Liberal\n§gThe old political order that was dismantled in the war between the states was influenced by many who now are part of the Brazilian Liberal party. Like the more influential and powerful Republicans, the Liberals are closer to a federation of parties that exist at a state level than a proper organisation with a unified vision and set of proposals. The fall of the old party chiefs swayed the balance of power among liberals away from the traditional centres, and thus many of the notables in the party are from South or Northeastern areas of Brazil. In general, they lack the apparatus and personnel the Republicans have used to share their names and their candidates with the common folk, even if they do have many newspapers and intellectuals favouring their party. The ideological heterodoxy of the party is great, and the most common unifying factor is a belief in positivist and classical liberal ideals, but even those concepts are not universal among party members.§!"
 BRA_market_liberal_party: "PLD"
 BRA_market_liberal_party_long: "Partido Liberal Democráta\n§gThe most radical sections of the Liberal Party of Brazil are far less relevant in the current day and age, thanks to the already insignificant role of the Liberal party as a whole. Their socially and economically liberal viewpoints put them at odds with most of the common folk of Brazil, who are more focused on immediate solutions and issues than lofty ideals of equality. However, these men will not give up, and the time for Brazil to be a liberal democracy may yet come, where a man's worth is determined by his skill and talent, not station or birth.§!"
 BRA_radical_socialist_party: "CGT-FAB"
 BRA_radical_socialist_party_long: "Confederação Geral do Trabalho - Federação Anarquista Brasileira\n§gThe radical left in Brazil is extremely divided over minor nuances in ideology, and few can actually agree on what a Brazil ran by the workers would look like. The Brazilian Anarchist Federation and the Labour Confederation have in many ways attempted to remedy this by reconciling extremely disparate views under the banner of gaining better working conditions right now, rather than seeking utopia later. This simple goal grants it far larger adhesion than rival associations, and it enjoys relatively good membership in large cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Said large membership allows strikes to be powerful bargaining tools, and the frequent violent clashes have made the FAB and other socialist organisations associated with disorder and street battles in the public eye.§!"
 BRA_syndicalist_party: "PSB"
 BRA_syndicalist_party_long: "Partido Sindicalista Brasileiro\n§gBrazil's cultural and intellectual elites have long held highly francophile views and tastes, and the Revolution after the war certainly brought syndicalism to the forefront of most academic circles in Universities, bars and any other meeting places for these people. In time, press coverage and new literature help spread Syndicalism to several unions in Rio and other cities. Most of these orthodox syndicalists are either high ranking union figures or upper class intellectuals who seek to combat the extreme social inequality plaguing Brazil. The ideology's popularity is restricted, a consequence of its leadership's lack of political clout outside of labour circles. As of the late '30s they are a frequent target from far rightists who see them as foreign agents attempting to subvert the nation to become an atheist nation.§!"
 BRA_totalist_party: "MMN"
 BRA_totalist_party_long: "Movimento Maximalista Nacional\n§gMaximalism as a political doctrine in Brazil dates back to the first few meetings of socialists in the country, meetings that were held in Porto Alegre decades before the ED was born. Rejecting lofty ideas of peaceful transition, the movement has explicitly stated their goal of purging Brazil of its slavery-ridden capitalistic past and industrialising it into a better tomorrow, to ensure socialism can exist for future generations of Brazilians. §!"

 BRA_Army_Reform_Soft: "Army Reform"
 BRA_Army_Reform_Soft_desc: "If there is one lesson to be learned from the events of 1927, is that the backlash from attempting to infringe in the military and administrative autonomy of states is instant and quite extreme. Command and operational centralisation does not, necessarily, imply a complete foregoing of existing military structure; after all, the victorious German army worked with several different armies of its constituent states under its national armed forces. \n\n§GCentralisation§!: [?BRA_reform_soft|0+%%]"

 BRA_Army_Reform_Hard_desc: "An army without cohesion is little more than a collection of armed people. Brazil cannot be held back by antiquated notions of decentralised military command; dissolving the antiquated, past century hierarchy of the state armies and militias will not be an easy task, especially so as those in cushy, pointless administrative and officer jobs will suddenly see their lazy career paths at risk, and the soldiers themselves might resent such direct meddling from the top, as they naturally tend to do. However, there is little time to act; Brazil's enemies amass at its borders, and we must be ready, no matter the price. \n\n§GCentralisation§!: [?BRA_reform_hard|0+%%]"

### Characters ###
 BRA_claudio_franco_de_sa_santoro: "Claudio Franco de Sá Santoro"
 BRA_claudio_franco_de_sa_santoro_leader_desc: "Claudio Franco de Sá Santoro was born in Manaus in 1919 and is an extremely renowned musician and composer. His music career began while still young, but his involvement with the Internationale is just as old, as he often found his colleagues involved with syndicalist and leftist organisations even from very early. His longstanding leftist sympathies made his art become quite the partisan affair, but since the establishment of the Union his work has received far greater attention, rather than scorn. Now using his fame in politics, the Manauense seeks to continue the work of his predecessors in the Union, and has for the time being left music as little more than a hobby, while many within Brazil worry about his relative lack of experience in positions of such importance"

 BRA_joao_amazonas_de_souza_pedroso: "João Amazonas de Souza Pedroso"
 BRA_joao_amazonas_de_souza_pedroso_leader_desc: "Born in Belém in 1919, João Amazonas de Souza Pedroso's involvement with politics and the socialist movement began relatively recently, in 1932, during one of the first actions of the newly founded Democratic Left in his hometown. While initially a social democrat, as the years went by he drifted further left, frustrated with the power the landowners had over democratic institutions and growing more and more cynical of the capacity of democracy to bring real change to his home. Now, he is in a position to do much more after the liberation of Brazil, as the head of state and chairman of his homeland, and bring the modern age to Pará as a whole; and this time, it's the landowners who are at the mercy of the proletariat, and not the other way around. In due time, he hopes, the lands around the river he was named for will become known as a shining example of socialist success and prosperity."

 BRA_abilio_de_nequete: "Abilio de Nequete"
 BRA_abilio_de_nequete_leader_desc: "An Orthodox Christian hailing from Lebanon, Abilio de Nequete is actually not his birth name, that being Abdo Nakt. He came to Brazil looking for his father, who had emigrated years earlier than him, in 1903, and reunited with him shortly thereafter. However, soon their political differences put a wedge on their relationships, and later on Abilio converted to Spiritism and joined union circles. Inspired by the revolutions in Europe, he joined the anarchist International Workers Union, but their militant atheism caused him and some other men to split off and form the Maximalist Union, a party that opposed their ideas in more matters than just religion. The Maximalist movement grew and garnered much strength in Porto Alegre, but still he faced opposition from anarchist unions, who were still the majority in the city, but his influence grew with time. In recent years, he was influenced by other centralist socialists abroad, and his Maximalist Union was one of the many leftist movements to support the so called Democratic Left. He is well respected by most Syndicalists in Brazil, even if his scathing and combative personality got him kicked out of more than one meeting. To him, Brazil's many issues after a decade of chaos can only be solved by a firm hand and unity among the people, a view shared by many army and navy officers. However, anarchists are still the biggest opponents to him in the political arena."

 BRA_minervino_de_oliveira: "Minervino de Oliveira"
 BRA_minervino_de_oliveira_leader_desc: "Like many of Brazil's poor, Minervino de Oliveira began to work as a child, and from his earliest years of adulthood he already was an influential union member, and also an early member of the Brazilian Syndicalist Party and contributor to leftist newspapers. By the time the New Republic arose, he was a natural candidate to enter the political arena, and he entered Rio's city council in 1928. In the next decade, his staunch defence of workers rights and support of strikes garnered him many admirers and even more enemies. In 1936, his support to the Democratic Left front of João Mangabeira was a key turning point in the ideologically charged and contentious electoral race, and he became nationally known after the endorsement. Thrust into his new position by the first congress of trade unions, Oliveira is the first black president and the first syndicalist to occupy the highest office in the country, and the nation holds its breath to see what will come to pass during the Oliveira government."

Long involved in the Democratic Left and before that the CGT, he found himself rapidly rising in the ranks of Brazilian syndicalist circles, thanks to his no nonsense attitude and oratory talent; albeit some claim this is due to his father's influence, not his own talent. His faith in syndicalism is unabated by the crises that followed the past decade in the world, and he took an active part in bringing it to his home. Now, he has taken up the great responsibility of leading his new nation, and to finish the fight against the capitalist rot of Brazil for good, and seeks to implement extensive reforms on almost all matters of state.

 BRA_luis_carlos_prestes: "Luís Carlos Prestes"
 BRA_luis_carlos_prestes_leader_desc: "While he hails from Rio Grande do Sul, Luís Carlos Prestes started his political career in Rio de Janeiro, where he became an officer and partook in Tenentist revolts, especially left wing ones. There, he was also exposed to the new ideals of Syndicalism as espoused in Europe, and formally joined that movement shortly after the New Republic was established in 1927, and even spent some years in France, at the behest of that country's government. This naturally made him suspect to many who assumed him to be a foreign agent, but his charisma and aggressive politics ensured he remained a relevant figure, and now not only did he finally manage to liberate Brazil from capitalism, but was elected as the chairman of the nation. He has widespread, nearly nationwide military support, due to his long standing principles of anti-corruption struggle, but he's also kept in touch with officers and diplomats from his time in France. Said international connections and charisma made him a natural choice for the leader of the newly founded commune, and now he assumes a position at the absolute forefront of the revolutionary vanguard. A somewhat reserved man regarding personal matters, he has never married, once stating that he 'never met the one'. While the worst period of post-revolutionary unrest has come and gone, it's still a tenuous balance that keeps the political authority of the Union together, but Prestes's longstanding military connections afford the nation a great deal of stability in these turbulent times."

Living in a situation of quasi-exile until the civil war, he later became a extremely influential leader of the far left, constantly pushing politically for worker's legislation and such left wings causes, and partook in some tenentist revolts in his youth years, often at great cost to his prospective career as an officer. However, he is seen with immense distrust by right wing civilians and military alike due to his close links to the Internationale, including a recent trip to France and Britain.§!\n\n§YNotes: Sometimes known by the rather lofty nickname of 'Knight of Hope' for his constant struggle in favour of the poor."

 BRA_patricia_rehder_galvao: "Patrícia Rehder Galvão"
 BRA_patricia_rehder_galvao_leader_desc: "Patrícia Rehder Galvão, sometimes referred to as her pseudonym of Pagu, is one of the youngest and most energetic leaders of the left in Brazil. Born in 1910 to a German mother and a French father in the town of São João da Boa Vista, she started her forays into both politics and writing at an early age, despite her deeply conservative background, with a small role at a newspaper in 1925, at age 15, and joined modernist and heavily left leaning circles at 18 shortly after finishing school. The nickname of Pagu derives from one of her fellow modernist writers mistakenly assuming her name to be Patríca Goulart, and stuck as a moniker throughout her life since then. Her political activism truly started in the 1930s, as she and other intellectuals felt that all the turmoil of the last decade did little to improve the situation of her fellow Brazilians. Her former husband was none other than Oswald de Andrade, who also happens to be influential among syndicalist intellectuals, and is nowadays a close political associate of his ex-wife, despite the relatively turbulent divorce they experienced, allegedly due to bouts of jealousy after one of the couple's many visits to the Commune of France, due to their shared views and values for the future of the country as a whole. As if the institution of the Union of Brazil wasn't enough to infuriate conservatives, the election of a divorced, single woman to the position is bound to intensely irritate those who still believe the government to be illegitimate, and Patrícia's short temper for those who believe they can tell her what to do is bound to cause political attrition."

 BRA_jose_oswald_de_sousa_de_andrade_leader_desc: "A paulista born in the capital of that state in 1890, José Oswald de Sousa de Andrade has always been an intellectual first and a politician second, but his influence on leftist circles across Brazil cannot be understated. His role in the modernist is quite extensive, with some coming as far as calling him its founder and main proponent. While he used to be married to Patricia Rehder Galvão, who is more known by her nickname Pagu, the marriage broke down in less than half a decade, as did his previous marriage to another renowned artist, Tarsila do Amaral. While he is known for generally humoured and spirited demeanour, he also is described as combative and often aggressive in arguments, which may explain his relationship's short duration. Still, his charisma carried him with relative ease to a victory in swaying the congress of trade unions to choose him as the leader of the revolution, a task he plans to take on very seriously. While his literary and artistic identity is well defined, few can guess what kind of leader he will be on the international arena, and the nation now pays close attention whether he will make friends or enemies when meeting with foreign diplomats."

 BRA_lila_ripoll: "Lila Ripoll"
 BRA_lila_ripoll_leader_desc: "Born in a small town in Rio Grande do Sul in 1905, Lila Ripoll began her public life as studying and performing music in Porto Alegre, but she also was a poet before she entered politics, a sudden change she and few around her could have predicted. Such a sudden change came when her cousin Waldemar Ripoll was assassinated in 1936, allegedly on the orders of one of the major local strongmen, Flores da Cunha. This strengthened her resolve, and compelled her to join the unions in their strikes. Her determination to make a positive impact, constant and active political presence, and rising renown among the Unions of Brazil, who see her and her story as a symbol of worker's struggle, and of merit and competency, made her a natural choice to run for the post of chairwoman by the unions of Rio Grande do Sul, and their pitch has been welcomed by the Congress, who named Lila their leader. Now, she hopes to make a positive impact in the country, but her idealism may clash with the tough choices ahead, and the world in conflict around her."

 BRA_eugenia_alvaro_moreyra_leader_desc: "Eugênia Álvaro Moreyra was born in Juiz de Fora, in the state of Minas Gerais, in 1898. After the early death of her father, she and her mother moved to Rio de Janeiro, where she was self taught in proper Portuguese and French. Shortly after her first job at age 15, she joined the A Rua newspaper as a reporter, a fact so unprecedented a brand new work was coined for a female reporter, reportisa. She was one of the key figures in the suffragette movement, and she also became the first major female political figure in leftist and modernist circles, and in these same circles she met her future husband, the poet Álvaro Moreyra, whom she married in 1914. Having been among the earliest members of the PSB and the ED alongside her closest associates like Oswald de Andrade and Carlos Lacerda, she has a longstanding influence on the going's on of the left wing in capital of Rio, and therefore the entire nation, for decades, and this influence has made her one of the key figures of the new Union of Brazil. Her aggressive activism towards gender equality has some less enthusiastic revolutionaries worried about the pace of the changes imposed on the generally conservative Brazilian public, she nevertheless remains undeterred and in her dedication to the cause that has taken most of her life by now."

Often bothered by what she considers ideological orthodoxy standing in the way of eradicating poverty, especially in her home state of Ceará, she was something of a consensus candidate among the several disparate groups that have arisen in the congress, with the backing of several northeastern delegates behind her. This position also may complicate her situation in executive matters, but she believes that working with a focus on the education of the lower orders will bring about greater prosperity than simple industrialisation programmes, or building huge railways across the nation."

 BRA_armanda_alvaro_alberto_leader_desc: "Few women have worked for the feminist and educational causes as long, and as strongly, as Armanda Álvaro Alberto. A founding member of the Brazilian Femine Union, she also was a pioneer in establishing the Proletarian School model, where poor children were granted both food and education from the school, but also she had great influence from foreign innovations in education, especially from Montessori's New School method. She has always defended a position where women of all categories must join to fight for their rights, but also against divisive rhetoric that paints men as an enemy of women, which she saw as shallow and petty. Her position at the forefront of socialist movements has landed her more than one tenure in jail, but also great fame and acclaim in political circles. Her main goals are to combat hunger and the shoddy state of education in the entirety of Brazil, spreading a standardised method of teaching to schools all across the nation."

 BRA_edgard_frederico_leuenroth: "Edgard Frederico Leuenroth"
 BRA_edgard_frederico_leuenroth_leader_desc: "Born in the city of Mogi Mirim in 1881, Edgard Frederico Leuenroth is one Brazil's foremost anarcho-syndicalists, with a very extensive history in the labour movement. Having moved to the great city of São Paulo at the young age of five, Edgard abandoned his studies and began working at age 10; his education was completely self taught years afterwards. Having managed to get positions in many newspapers in the city, by the turn of the century he found himself attracted to socialism, and quickly began working for leftist publications instead. His work was very aggressive against both government and faith, and he was arrested multiple times during the early 20th century. The success of the Revolution in France filled him and his colleagues with hope, and he alongside them spearheaded the general strikes at the end of the century's second decade, even if he was not involved in the infamous armed uprisings against the national government. This made him both very well known amongst the left, and a hated figure amongst right wingers, with his newspaper's headquarters openly attacked in the early 1920’s twice. While he, as with many left activists, saw the events of 1927 with hope, soon they realised that the new status quo gained little tangible for the workers, and agitation started yet again. Having most recently taken part in the protests following Black Monday, Edgard has never given up on his dream of a more equal and fair Brazil, and his notoriety makes his rise to the position of chairman very unsurprising. However, the birthing pains of this new, socialist Brazil are just beginning, and the man has a long and laborious task ahead of him."

She was publishing books as early as 1918 and started to author articles 8 years before that, and during this period she began to be influenced by anarchist and syndicalist thought. Despite issues with suffragette movements, whom she saw as 'not fighting for enough change', she has always been one of the foremost feminist activists in the country, something that no doubt influenced in her choice as Chairwoman by progressive minded delegates, but she also has held a position among the most respected leftist academics and authours on São Paulo. Now, Brazil's head of state has the daunting task of leading the continuing socialisation of the government, rising demands of officers and the ever contentious Congress of Trade Unions, as some still rose issues regarding her birthplace, but her experience and fame seem to indicate she is more than prepared for the task; or so the nation hopes."

 BRA_astrojildo_pereira_duarte_silva: "Astrojildo Pereira Duarte Silva"
 BRA_astrojildo_pereira_duarte_silva_leader_desc: "Astrojildo Pereira Duarte Silva is a native of the town Rio Bonito, near Rio, and was born in 1890, and left his hometown to the far larger Niterói, the state capital of Rio de Janeiro. There he began his studies in earnest, and after coming into contact with the intellectuals there, he decided to abandon said studies to focus solely on subjects he actually cared about, such as literature and politics. He avidly backed Ruy Barbosa, a reformist liberal, against Hermes da Fonseca, a marshall, in the 1910 elections, and the defeat, coupled with the increasingly repressive actions of the federal government, made him utterly sceptical of traditional politics. He was then, in that same year, drawn to anarchism and syndicalism causes, and began his trajectory in the worker's movement in Rio. He worked tirelessly to organise the worker's movement, creating associations and playing a key role organising the CGT and the FAB into articulate institutions capable of defending the rights of workers, and was one of their key leaders during recent decades. His distrust of traditional politics made dealings with the Democratic Left difficult, and he was often one of the voices opposing 'class appeasement' with the men he saw as nothing but liars. His popularity and influence among anarchists and syndicalist circles made his election to the position of chairman something of a political inevitability, but even still he is more or less a complete unknown to most Brazilians, who apprehensively watched the old order be replaced with the Union of Brazil. Now that conventional politics and its corruption are gone, Astrojildo can finally get working into establishing the country he envisioned, built by workers, for the workers, while keeping the fragile political peace currently in place."

 BRA_antonio_avelino_foscolo: "Antonio Avelino Fóscolo"
 BRA_antonio_avelino_foscolo_leader_desc: "A member of the old guard of the Brazilian left, Avelino Fóscolo was born in 1864 in Sabará, Minas Gerais, still in the days of the Empire. While at his youth he wandered around the country, allegedly even trouping with the circus, by the 1880s he had left his mark in his hometown's press, championing the abolition of slavery and anti-monarchistic views, and by end of the century's first decade, he was already deeply involved with anarchism in the city of Paraopéba, then called Taboleiro Grande, while he worked as a pharmacist. It was during this time he also began writing books, romances usually coloured with less than subtle political undertones as was typical of literature of the time. While he later moved to Belo Horizonte permanently, he also frequently visited Rio and lent his support to the strikes and the labour movement in that city, making him one of the chief figures among anarchists nationwide. And old man, with several children and a life nearing its end, the ideologically orthodox Avelino may well find difficult to reconcile his strong principles with the realities of governing a nation as vast as Brazil, especially considering the intense political turmoil it is experiencing, even if the same adherence to ideological precepts allowed his election in the first place."

 BRA_everardo_dias: "Everardo Dias"
 BRA_everardo_dias_leader_desc: "Everardo Dias was actually born in the town of Pontevedra in Spain, and came to Brazil while very young in 1887, as his father fled his home country. He started working at age 13 on a major Paulista newspaper, but his studies later turned towards law, as is all to common for Brazilian politicians. A long time anti-clerical and anti-censorship advocate, Everardo was writing about his political thoughts as early as 1902, and has partook in most great strikes and political actions by socialist and anarchist elements in São Paulo in this century, being one of the most recognisable figures of the movement. His long and storied history with the labour movement was doubtlessly a chief factor to see his name put forward by the congress of trade unions as the head of their council, but he also is a conciliatory and non radical figure, always defending differing viewpoints and the right of non socialist opposition do demonstrate and even put forward candidates for certain offices. While some claim this comes from a misguided sense of camaraderie with his fellow freemasons and former political associates in the republican era, the truth is simply his ever staunch defence of free speech, as a system that cannot withstand criticism is not strong enough to do real change in a country as vast and unequal as Brazil."

Always having been a prolific artist, he started his career as a helper in the restoration of churches in his hometown, and at just age 16 he moved to Rio to enrol in the national school of arts, where his talent was immediately recognised. Since then, his position as one of the foremost artists of the nation has solidified, but his political career is far more recent, having only in recent times become truly active as an elected union representative. While his political experience is somewhat limited, his talent and intellect made him well known, and as with many other elections, this fame placed him an advantageous position when compared to his fellow candidates. While it's certainly an advantage for a head of state to be such a respected artist, especially on the international level, many raise concerns about having such an inexperienced man as head of state."

While also a teacher and journalist, his dedication to the political cause has been intensified since the revolution, as real change finally arrived to Brazil. Having gained significant support from his fellow northeastern union representatives, Djalma now prepares to take the helm of Brazil's socialist government, and seeks to turn development efforts to northeast, as he feels previous governments have put the needs of urban, industrial workers ahead of the great many Brazilians who still work on the fields and on small towns across the nation. Such a paradigm shift is popular in non central regions, but naturally less so in Rio, São Paulo and other major urban centres. Time will tell whether these extensive reform programmes will be successful or not."

Early on in his career he was a close and passionate follower of Rui Barbosa, but after his mentor's passing, he carved a career of its own as a federal representative of the state of Bahia. A man with deeply rooted anti-authoritarian principles, he was a vocal supporter of Bahia's role in the civil conflict, and gained notoriety as a result. As his career went by, the continuous and yet seemingly fruitless struggle of Brazil's poor brought him closer to the left, and while he certainly has some socialist views and allies in union and intellectual circles, he certainly is no Syndicalist. His plan for Brazil was to build a broad leftist front to oppose the current status quo, and his success was unexpected, but probably not unpredictable considering the social upheaval following Black Monday and the scandalous repression of labour movements nationwide. Now, he has to juggle the several disparate factions in his left front while keeping the ravenous opposition at bay, and it seems his presidency is certainly going to be as eventful as his brother's."

He has always been a bit more left leaning than his father however, and his election may well be the shake-up the left in Brazil needed in this decade, as many of the old slogans and talking points have been rendered moot by changes in legislation. Frequently accused of being a syndicalist or a populist, Jango is steadfast in his moderate stance, defending that all voices are heard, but also vehemently denying claims of syndicalism.

While a teacher, she has worked on special schools to help other jews fleeing Europe in the following decades of chaos and unrest on the continent. Having been a political activist from a very young age, Elisa was one of the few openly socialist politicians to run for office under the ED umbrella and succeed in the contentious 1936 elections, being always a voice for the worker's movement in parliament. Her general political experience put her ahead of the pack in the selection process for chairman, but even still gathering the necessary support was by no means an easy feat, as Brazil's unions are even more decentralised in terms of ideology and state lines than the previous parties once were. Now in power and leading Brazil's nascent socialist government, Elisa has to deal with a tumultuous foreign and internal political landscape, and ensure that the planned industrialisation and development programmes go on as planned. Thankfully, the worst, more shaky years of the new status quo seems to be the in past, and she seems more than capable of achieving her goals."

Now known nationwide as the 'Red Senator' after a long tenure maintaining worker's rights at the forefront, she has to assuage military personnel's rampant fear of a syndicalist coup, as her proposals, while seen as overly moderate by her fellow syndicalists, are extremely radical for a nation like Brazil. However, the longstanding dissatisfaction of the common people with the seemingly endless inability of the federal government to end poverty, unemployment and other far more pressing concerns than ideological disagreements have ensured she managed to win a democratic election and become the first female to do so. Now she has to deal not only with the traditionally conservative elites, but with a constantly divided and bickering powerbase in an even less stable legislature; and yet she wholly believed she can turn Brazil's fortunes around for good."

 BRA_antonio_augusto_borges_de_medeiros: "Antônio Augusto Borges de Medeiros"
 BRA_antonio_augusto_borges_de_medeiros_leader_desc: "Few men alive had as much of an impact in Brazilian politics, and especially in the Rio Grande do Sul state, as Antônio Augusto Borges de Medeiros, known politically by his last two names. Starting his political career in the 1890s, he swiftly rose through the ranks and assumed the position of state president from 1898 to 1908 and from 1913 to 1926, and was at the centre of the innumerable political crises, revolts and intrigues in Rio Grande do Sul during the timeframe, while also steadily rising to national prominence. Considered by many a man of unparalleled charisma and integrity, Borges refused a judicial position early in his life, in 1892, to focus entirely on politics, and has always tried to strike a balance between his ideas for a progressive Brazil and the whirlwind of political forces in his country and state. Having positioned himself very publicly in favour of São Paulo in 1927, his views on the integrity of the state's sovereignty remain unchanged, as does his disdain for any centralising overtures by the government in Rio de Janeiro. Now elected president at nearly his eighties, his positivist beliefs are stauncher than ever, after the national-level schism of the liberal party and a contested electoral race. While establishing a parliamentary majority and governing the large democracy is a challenge, Borges' gravitas and personal charm will no doubt play an important role in keeping the republic on the way to progress."

 BRA_ildo_meneghetti_leader_desc: "Born and raised in Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Ildo Meneghetti is a relative newcomer to politics, being more well known in his home city for being several times president of Sport Club Internacional, one of the three major football teams in the city. This by itself is probably the most divisive facet of the relative newcomer, who joined the Liberals due to his disapproval of working with syndicalist and workers movements as closely as the Left Democrats do. An engineer by trade, his late foray into politics was a mayoral position in Porto Alegre in the last years, which he performed well enough to gain immense popularity there as a politician. Still, the leap from Mayor to President is fairly uncommon and a major milestone in Brazil's democratic history. Assembling a legislative majority will seemingly be the major hurdle for his government, as hardline Republicans are likely to refuse to vote for anything put forward by the Liberals; but such are the rules of this new game he chose to get himself involved with."

 BRA_wilson_barbosa_martins: "Wilson Barbosa Martins"
 BRA_wilson_barbosa_martins_leader_desc: "By and large a newcomer to politics, even if he is from a traditional political family in Mato Grosso, Wilson Barbosa Martins was born in Campo Grande in 1917, and witnessed first hand as a child the upheaval of the worst years of Brazil's republic, as his father joined the effort to oust the federal government during the struggle between São Paulo and the federal government. Since then, he has walked the somewhat typical path of local politicians towards the federal sphere, including being elected a state representative and then a federal one. Such a young man, no matter how successful, would have any under normal circumstances scant chances at being nominated to run for president, however, the split of the Liberal party left the faction with a dire need for leadership and renewed impetus, and Wilson has managed to garner support amongst those who seek change in the party, but did not leave it. After a close election in which he did not gain control of the house, his political situation is tenuous, with many older politicians dismissing him as an inexperienced youngster from a backwater state, a sentiment often shared by the press in Rio de Janeiro. A coalition with the Liberal Republicans, even if something extremely contentious, is perhaps the man's best hope at a stable government, lest he risks having even his most trivial proposals to the house constantly overturned."

Of these revolts, his role in the large scale uprising in São Paulo is of great importance, as he saw the federal meddling as a direct attack on republican principles. Having somewhat recently ended a term as president of São Paulo, Toledo decided he was ready to become president of the nation now, even while well into his eighties. His age is seen as his main obstacle by the people, but politics is rarely that simple, and his presidential victory did not grant his party full control of the lower house, which might very well be an issue unless he is willing to work with some of the more virulent opposition politicians.

 BRA_joaquim_francisco_de_assis_brasil_leader_desc: "A true old timer of Rio Grande do Sul politics, Joaquim Francisco de Assis Brasil is a well respected politician, backed by his years of experience dealing with both local and national party members. His career started in 1884, still in the waning years of the Empire, and he became an important figure during the Old Republic era, even if at a national level he was often overshadowed by other natives of his state, he performed very important roles, including vital diplomatic missions to Argentina, Mexico, the USA and more. A true gaucho, Joaquim adores the free country life of the plains, even if he is not advised to ride horses anymore due to his advanced age. Still, he always associated the freedom of the gaucho rider with that of the republican freedoms, and even if not a separatist, places a deep value to the traditions of a state. He is also a prolific historical and political writer, even if some of the concepts proposed in his books, like that of an 'voting machine' to prevent fraud, do seem truly outlandish. While his victory has led to rabid optimism by most party members, he knows that keeping control of the lower house may well be a far more difficult affair than they predict, as the Liberal majority is tenuous at best, and the party remains relatively fractured even after the split."

Afterwards, he began his by now very long political career. While he is a well known figure in Belo Horizonte, where he even ran for the office of mayor in the past, and has been a representative in Rio multiple times, his clout outside of his home state has always been somewhat limited, even after the victory in the election, as the Liberal party has to juggle with opposition at every corner of congress. However, even with these issues, JK, as he is more commonly known to the public, has big plans. Not just urban renewal, infrastructure investments or political reforms, he is a very vocal proponent of the proposal of moving the capital of the nation further inland to push development in the great hinterlands of the Cerrado plains, which would be an outrageously expensive endeavour. Regretfully for him, and thankfully for the state budget some say, such a proposal is already dead on arrival, with massive opposition from several groups in parliament and prominent newspapers."

But he also has big plans for both Rio and Belo Horizonte, cities in dire need of extensive public works, but already many in his opposition call these planes a \"hurricane of spending\", and yet he remains undeterred.

His beliefs clashed with other, older politicians and less liberally inclined members of the party, but his urban remodelling and subsequent tenure as Mayor of São Paulo made him well known nation wide, and thus he was picked to lead the splinter liberal ticket. His lack of political experience, especially at the national arena, may make his government quite the eventful affair, as his plans to remodel the country's fiscal and infrastructure systems may very well find stiff resistance in parliament, even with his own party's views. However, the fact that a man that isn't an establishment politician managed to enter the Catete is seen well by most of the populace."

 BRA_raul_pilla: "Raul Pilla"
 BRA_raul_pilla_leader_desc: "An influential man with strong ideals, Raul Pilla is often referred to as 'the Pope of Parliamentarism' in his home state, even if his plans for reform of the federal government have scant chances of success considering the current political climate. Born in 1892 in Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Raul's career in politics stated when he was only 17 years old, and even during this early age, his position against a strong executive power coming from this early stage in his career, as it was one of the banners of one of the many decentralisation-friendly groups in that state, and often found himself in the complex disputes between factions in that state. The conflict between São Paulo and the Federal government was one where he naturally sided against the centralisers, whom he saw as violating the rights of states, and alongside his chief ally in his home state, Borges de Medeiros, fully supported the movement in an astonishingly rare moment of political unity in Rio Grande do Sul alongside other parties. Having since positioned himself against the Republican party, whose centralising overtures in the past few years seem hypocritical at best considering the cause of the war that divided Brazil so recently, he joined Borges de Medeiros's splinter liberal party, as the two men also saw issues with what they perceived as an ineffectual opposition. His election as president is ironic, as he seeks to abolish the office in favour of one of a parliament elected prime minister, but he knows this is not a possibility in the short term, and his control of the house is tenuous at best. For now, the priority of him and the rest of the Republican Liberals is to undo some of the more egregious reforms from previous governments, while defending the rights of individual states."

While the nomination was a challenge in itself, few perhaps with the exception of the man himself expected an electoral victory for the presidency. His main goal while at the helm of the republic is one that has defined his political career, his long standing desire for a better and more developed Goyaz, even if his ideas on how to reach said goal have changed quite a bit over the years. After decades of what he sees as neglect, he plans to bring great amounts of investment to hinterlands of eastern Brazil, and in doing so will probably draw the ire of Southeastern politicians who expect to be at the top of the pecking order, not to mention the substantial parliamentary issues a party like his inevitably will face while in power."

 BRA_landry_sales_goncalves_leader_desc: "A native of Acaraú and born in 1904, Landry Sales Gonçalves started his career as a military officer, and both took part on rebellions back in the Old Republic and interacted with several key figures of the tenentist uprisings that would follow. While he did flirt with the AIB during the rise of that party, he since has adopted more classical liberal stances while keeping his militarist political thought, and has been elected president with great support from fellow officers in campaigning. His outlook towards politics also changed over the years, and he is more in favour of de-escalating tensions and a generally less active role of active officers in political affairs. His nomination by the party was somewhat contested, but the true challenge will be to retain control of congress with a significant house minority, especially since there is little chance of the Liberal factions cooperating even this long after their political split, albeit there is nothing a few ministerial positions can't solve, some say. Regardless, his presidency is probably going to be one of the most difficult affairs in recent memory, but the man is used to both the harsh life of the barracks and the ever shifting loyalties of politics."

 BRA_otavio_mangabeira: "Otávio Mangabeira"
 BRA_otavio_mangabeira_leader_desc: "Otavio made his political debut in 1908 at the contentious politics of the state of Bahia, and his rapid rise in notoriety gave him fame, and some exiles from the state as well. Said notoriety was enough for him to later become a State Representative in 1912. His staunch positions in favour of the late Washington Luis and João Pessoa during the times of civil war helped to raise his profile to greater heights, and he was elected president of the State of Bahia in the elections organised there in 1928. Later, as consensus bid for the Brazilian Republican Party, his name was put forward for the position of President of the Republic, and was endorsed by then President João Pessoa. His presidency was very much a return to normalcy at first, but the rise of radical movements especially in the cities, and public order in general, is a rising concern. However, the good pace of economic and political recovery has ensured his popularity remains high, and it is possible that some of this popularity is why João Mangabeira, his brother, became a household name in more left wing circles."

Like most men in influential families, Gustavo studied law in university, becoming a city councillor in Pitangui shortly after his graduation. He has climbed the ranks in the PR very quickly, and while he is a capable man, this is in no small part due to the immense influence wielded by his close friend and associate Getúlio Vargas, as he is one of the few that has the gaucho's trust. His nomination and election campaign had Vargas's widespread support, as cartoonists often drew Capanema as little more than his sockpuppet. But despite these attacks, he remains a staunch ally to Vargas, who now leads his political articulation in congress to ready for a smooth republican government. While many rejoice the stability of the orderly elections, some worry that the oligarchs of the plantations of the old republic have been replaced with a new type of politician, far more cunning and malleable. Capanema, of course, knows these to be only the rumblings of a defeated and scattered opposition, as the many newspapers under republican control will surely begin sharing in the coming months. His politics of self strengthening and industrialisation have much in common with Vargas's, as well."

 BRA_affonso_alves_de_camargo: "Affonso Alves de Camargo"
 BRA_affonso_alves_de_camargo_leader_desc: "Although he was born in the town of Guarapuava, Paraná, in 1873, Afonso Alves de Camargo moved to Curitiba later on his life, after he finished his studies in law school, as it was all too common for politicians in Brazil at the time. In the state capital of Paraná, he found himself involved in the local power struggles between centralist and federalist factions, in which he positioned himself against the national government. Shortly after the hostilities of this state civil war ended, in 1894, he formally entered politics as a state representative, and steadily climbed the political ladder; he became state president of Paraná, and later a federal representative and a senator. During this time, he positioned himself in favour of the Brazil Railway Company in the Contestado Affair, which caused a significant dent in the veteran politician's popularity, but did not affect his political power, as his handpicked successor won the elections after his term as State President with relative ease. A state senator at the time of the crisis that engulfed Brazil in 1927, he later returned to state to serve yet again as state president, and became the chief figure among Republicans in the state in recent years. While he isn't in Vargas's inner circle like most senior Republican leaders, his influence and seniority add much credibility to his nomination, even though some claim he's just 'more of the same', and is seen by opposition as just another ageing oligarch seeking more power. However, opposition within his own party is a far more credible threat to his administration's political success, as Vargas and his associates still hold immense sway in the party's house membership, and a shaky base there could have negative ramifications for his government."

While he at first tried to volunteer for opposition militias, his remarkably poor aim and physical disposition had him rejected, and he spent the war at home, while having difficulties finding a job during the economic depression that hit the nation. Some years after the war, he joined the Republican party and began the slow climb through its ranks, becoming a representative at city hall and the state legislature before heading to Rio's parliament. While his loyalties certainly lie with the Republicans, his somewhat moderate stances on key issues gave him a meaningful leg over other candidates, in what was a fairly contested election, even if the wanton violence of 1936 has been long left behind. His stances on economical and social issues are also why he has a relatively stable control of the upper and lower houses, but the ever eventful politics of Brazil may well surprise even the most skilled of politicians."

 BRA_osvaldo_euclides_de_sousa_aranha_leader_desc: "Osvaldo Euclides de Sousa Aranha hails from the town of Alegrete, in Rio Grande do Sul. Ever since the earliest points of his career, he has been seen as both a reliable mediator and a skilled administrator, skills sorely necessary in a state where political violence was at a breaking point until the state presidency of Getúlio Vargas, a man who is one of his closest allies and friends, and it's a common occurrence to see both side by side. Having spent most of his career as a diplomat after the Civil War, he returned to Brazil and politics at the request of his longtime friend, as a consensus candidate was sorely needed in the ranks of the ever fractured Republican party, even if the party itself is not nearly as divided and decentralised as it was during the early 1930s. His remarkable experience as a mediator is surely to be invaluable as the head of state, and it's widely predicted that his demeanour and relatively moderate stances will ensure one of the most stable and hopefully prosperous presidencies in Brazil's republican history, as his party gives him an extremely comfortable political position at the Catete. His years as a diplomat will also hopefully help with diplomacy abroad, as Brazil looks more than ever outwards in these new times."

Respected for his efforts during the Civil War and beyond, the officer has enough gravitas to pull together a haphazardly government, which is more or less a dictatorship all but in name, to keep order in this time of extreme crisis. He has a very public disdain of Syndicalism and all forms and socialist and has personally overseen the crushing of several revolts of this nature over the past decade."

While not fully supporting the Federal Government’s cause, he did not side with the Paulista alliance either. His command in Rio had him frequently square off against strikes and barracks uprisings of syndicalist nature, giving him an immense distaste for the ideology that caused this chaos, and he seldom hid his immense disregard for their movement, especially after they took over Chile and caused open war in Argentina. He is a leading figure among conservative officers,but has shown little interest in Integralist movements or ideology due to his more traditional conservative leanings, despite them sharing positions in violent opposition to Syndicalism. He is also personally opposed to any involvement of Brazil in European or overseas entanglements in general, preferring a generally neutral foreign policy for the nation.§!\n\n§YNotes: Eurico has a speech impediment, and always swaps the sounds for the letters C and X."

 BRA_getulio_dornelles_vargas_leader_desc: "Born and raised in the border state of Rio Grande do Sul, Getúlio Vargas always had a knack for politics. Since his earliest forays into state politics, he always was a skilled navigator and, according to some, a shrewd manipulator. While he only entered politics in 1913, by the time of the Revolution of 27 he was already State President of his home province, and his diplomatic skill managed to both prevent intervention from foreigners and to ensure that Rio Grande do Sul sided against the Federal forces. After the war, Vargas became Vice President under João Pessoa, and became far more well known nation wide, taking time to appear in radio and other public addresses as a man 'looking out for the little guy' while he could do so. Since Otávio Mangabeira took office, he spent four years articulating an energetic presidential campaign. Always professing non extreme, but powerful views on the future of Brazil, Vargas believes that the only way the nation can truly enter the modern era is through and extensive campaign of industrialisation, modernisation and rearmament, a process that he believes no person or law has any right to impede, for his intention is to always act with Brazil's best intentions first and foremost."

 BRA_gustavo_dodt_barroso_leader_desc: "Hailing from the Northeastern state of Ceará, Gustavo Dodt Barroso is one of the nation's most influential intellectuals and the leader of the Brazilian Integralist Action. While he's an accomplished author since age 23, his entry in the political arena came after watching a passionate speech about the values of Integralism by important figure, Arlindo Veiga dos Santos, in 1928. Ever since, he has dedicated himself to helping push the movement's agenda, writing several well selling books on the subject, but also his own anti-semitic views, especially in translating the hoax Protocols of the Elders of Zion in Brazilian Portuguese. This publication in particular has motivated some Integralists towards violence and vandalism against both Brazilian-born Jews and immigrants. Barroso dedicates himself to poetry and studies of Brazilian folklore, which garnered him a seat at the Brazilian Academy of Letters. His profound nationalism and hatred of perceived foreign meddling made him gain especial disdain and hatred for Syndicalists in Brazil, whom he claims are French spies sent to establish a puppet republic."

Having spent his childhood at Castle D'eu with the Imperial family in exile, he wasn't able to set foot in Brazil until the Decree of Banishment by the republic was revoked in the 1920s, even though he was deferred from serving in the armed forces in 1925. Having come to live permanently in Brazil after the civil war, which convinced him personally more than ever that a monarchy was needed by the people, he immediately started to articulate politically towards his restoration, and his scheme has finally come to fruition as he has been crowned Pedro III of Brazil. He has been prepared all his life, from childhood tutors to lessons as an adult, for this station he considers his birthright, but few things could prepare a man for the tumultuous times since Black Monday shattered the economic order of the world. While he certainly is thankful for the assistance of the Integralist movement in restoring him, his views towards the more radical wings of the party are not as positive as one could think, as their extreme views often clash with his milder ones."

 BRA_jose_bento_renato_monteiro_lobato_leader_desc: "A native of Taubaté, José Bento Renato Monteiro Lobato is among São Paulo's foremost intellectuals and authors, and has always had a penchant for getting his nose into politics since a young age. While he is known by most younger Paulistas as the author of beloved children's books and his escapades while campaigning for nationalisation of the Brazilian oil sector, the political class knows his radical and often erratic rhetoric dates back many years before he was thrust into power. A member of the São Paulo Eugenics Society, he has always advocated for harsh measures to maintain what he views as a pure society, and has even written books with highly prejudiced concepts behind them, and now openly praises the activities of the KKK, something he had previously done in private. His economic stances are no less extreme, defending radical nationalisation and industrialisation programmes; he has for decades argued against foreigners getting access to his nation's wealth. His belief in a harsh, 'dog eat dog' view of diplomatic affairs also is his north when dealing with other nations, especially his so called 'benefactors', whom he sees as a necessary ally to rid São Paulo of its 'worst elements' through an intense immigration incentive programme. Said abrasive rhetoric has certainly not fallen in deaf ears, but has also led to an escalation of social and racial violence across São Paulo, but it remains to be seen if this dog is all bark, or if Lobato's bite will truly leave its mark."

He rapidly climbed the political ladder, and soon rose to the prominent position he is now widely known for. His immense credibility is why he leads the confederation; while legally could not be president of Brazil again after his term, this is an entirely different entity, and he hopes to stabilise the newly founded republic, but also secure its prosperity and repair the extensive wartime damage across the country; but he will have to face stiff opposition from coroneis and other oligarchs across the nation, even if most state presidents of the federation are his allies."

Usually not one to meddle in political affairs, Rondon was shocked to find after an expedition that Brazil's ruling Integralist party was not only plotting to restore the monarchy, but also had seemingly ordered his arrest. He took up arms, and was joined by many across the country who loathed the monarchist and populist rhetoric of the Integralists, but still was at a severe strategic disadvantage. However, his knowledge of local terrain and lifetime of military experience, coupled with uprisings dividing the attention of the overstretched federal government, allowed his revolution to succeed.

In 1910 was named Minister of War in the Hermes da Fonseca administration, and juggled several high ranking positions in the republic ever since, reaching the rank of marshall just before the 1927 revolution. While his high ranking means he has with great frequency dealt with rebels, he generally grants them amnesty when they are fellow soldiers, such as in the common tenentist uprisings, but the harshness of the operation led by him the Contestado revolt in 1915 is still infamous.

From 1893 in the Federalist Revolt in his home state to now the Chilean Crisis, his steady hand and respect by the people and officers granted him enough political capital to proclaim himself provisional president. Despite persistent requests by other officers, especially from those further to the right who see his moderate voice as needed, Isidoro has stated in no uncertain terms that his government is temporary, and he will step down as soon as the Union representatives and delegates meet to select a ruler. Time will tell if this decision is the right one for the future of the country."

Between 1893 and 1895, he took part in a local revolt in Rio Grande do Sul, known as the Federalist Revolution, wherein he was defeated by government forces and exiled in Paris for a year before receiving amnesty. In 1926, he returned from Rio, where he was stationed, to Rio Grande do Sul, allegedly to deal with personal matters, but rising tensions in the capital clearly indicate it was to prepare for the inevitable conflict brewing. During the hostilities in 1927, Isidoro was in general command of the forces in the uprising, and thus is well known as the 'Marshall of the Revolution' for his leadership on the matter. Since then, his prestige has far surpassed those of other military leaders from the conflict, but he mostly keeps away from political affairs, albeit his disdain for the Old Republic is well known and vocal. He has been nonetheless invited to campaign for the Democratic Left, an offer which he refused, despite the fact his popularity is such that he may well be a viable presidential candidate.§!\n\n§YNotes: His previous exile in Paris left an impression of him, especially regarding how backwards Brazil is to him."

However, time stops for no man, and a cloud of uncertainty looms overhead, as the power vacuum Isidoro will leave behind when he dies will certainly have colossal consequence for the young republic and its people's hopes."

His republican beliefs frequently put him at odds with some radical integralist officers; while he today denies any ties with the movement, he did have some slight sympathy for their actions against syndicalist movements, even if not for their monarchism.

After returning, he, alongside fellow officers in the mission to Germany established the Defesa Nacional magazine, which defended several modernisation and reform measures for the armed forces based on the German Empire, which earned him and his associated the derogatory nickname of 'Young Turks', no doubt due to the high degree of francophilia amongst fellow officers and other members of the press.

Being on the winning side brought him many political advantages, and by 1936 he was an army major and one of the most influential servicemen in the nation. His most standout political belief is the strong opposition to any kind of syndicalist or socialist principles, and he always defended open war against any kind of internationalist regime as necessary to maintain peace and order. To him, syndicalists are enemies of freedom no matter what treaties they sign, and they seek to undermine the values of the nation as a way to replace them with the beliefs of Marx. This disposition might have had him in friendly terms with the AIB, were it not for his relatively strong republican beliefs.

But he also is defined by a strong bias against syndicalist and socialist views, which he saw as the primary threat to civilisation as a whole across the world. While his position as leader of the Confederation is none one he picked himself, he is determined to establish the rule of law by any means necessary, and he enjoys widespread support for this endeavour in the recently organised national army, as the military in the region has traditionally shifted towards the right wing.

He had short career in politics where he ordered the suppression of various uprisings. He is known as an enforcer of the old order, indeed, his conduct in the war in Contestado, concurrent with the early Weltkrieg, was deemed nearly criminal by many, though his methods proved successful. While his legalist stance remained unchanged in 1927, he eventually abandoned the federal government at the request of fellow northeastern officers. His political views are typical for an army officer in Brazil, though it can be argued his disdain for radical movements like integralism and syndicalism stems more from an association with sedition and disorder than any deep ideological opposition.§!\n\n§YNotes: Lost his arm in a dynamite mail-bomb attack after the turn of the century, and served briefly as a federal representative."

The young officer was from the outset involved in various revolts against the old republic, and was one of the many among this newer crop of officers to defect and mutiny against the federal government in 1927. This background made his anti-authoritarian stances harden, and to some he is even considered a radical officer, as he is one of the few who agree with the mostly opposition held view that Brazil's new republic needs still further massive changes and reforms to become a truly democratic nation. He has relatively close links with several other officers who are considered radical, but he is also a staunch nationalist even while strongly anti-authoritarian."

 BRA_bertoldo_ritter_klinger: "Bertoldo Ritter Klinger"
 BRA_bertoldo_ritter_klinger_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gJanuary 1st, 1884, in Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gJoined the Rio Pardo Military School in 1899, and completed military studies in Rio. Partook in the so-called 'Vaccine Revolt' in 1904 against mandatory vaccination of the people of Rio, and was arrested and spent a year in prison for the uprising. In 1910, Bertoldo was selected to be one of the key members in a military mission to Germany, and he stayed there until 1913, learning much about modern warfare, or at least the latest at the time, as he was stationed mostly with the 24th Artillery Regiment in Gustrow. After he returned, he and some fellow minded officers, like Euclides Figueiredo, started to publish magazines to publicly defend German-inspired modernisation of the army and country, which led to the group being mockingly referred to as the 'Young Turks' at the time. Their anti-status quo position naturally put them closer to the rebels in the 1927 revolution, but the extent of the reforms greatly disappointed Bertoldo, who still sees the military as woefully behind Germany and other world powers. He has since maintained his pro-German views and his publications on military matters, and has a strong anti-syndicalist stance as well."
 BRA_bertoldo_ritter_klinger_leader_desc: "Bertoldo Ritter Klinger, like many officers currently living in São Paulo, was born in the then Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, and garrisoned several locations across that country, including Rio. His actions and service during the Interstate War are quite noteworthy, as is his is exemplary record of always standing up for what he believed was the right thing, as his career was often set back by his participation in a variety of mutinies with an even greater variety of motivations, from opposing mandatory vaccination to better conditions in the barracks for infantrymen. His position at the forefront of such popular causes, and his staunch republican beliefs, have been decisive factors on making the officer the first president of the Republic of São Paulo, where he is seen a stabilising factor amidst the constant bickering of the nation's oligarchs and powerful families."

 BRA_araken_de_oliveira_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gOctober 8th, 1909, in Rio de Janeiro, Federal District, Brazil§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gPerhaps the youngest figure of note in the interstate war, he joined the army in 1927, and one year later started his formal military education at Realengo. Still a relatively young artillery officer, his rise through the ranks has been quite rapid for the relatively meritocracy-averse Brazilian military, no doubt due to the instability in recent years. His age is also why he carries no significant baggage regarding his allegiances in the 1927 revolution, as he was but an aspiring student officer. As with most officers, he leans towards the political right wing."
 BRA_araken_de_oliveira_leader_desc: "Born and raised in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Araken de Oliveira has always had the interests of Brazil at heart throughout his distinguished military career. A war veteran and respected officer, his current position as head of state is in no doubt due to the fact that only the remnants of the Brazilian army can maintain law and order throughout Vera Cruz. While the suspension, at least for now, of any kind of elections for executive power is indeed a harsh measure, harsh measures have to be taken if this young nation is to succeed in re-establishing the rule of law in both its cities and hinterlands, a task Araken has to undertake for the sake of his home."

 BRA_olimpio_mourao_filho: "Olímpio Mourão Filho"
 BRA_olimpio_mourao_filho_leader_desc: "Olympio Mourão Filho was born in 1900, in Diamantina, Minas Gerais. Having followed a fairly standard military career, his first active combat duty was during the interstate war, where he was among the defeated officers that sided with the federal government. He has since completely and utterly lost faith in the very concept of liberal democracy, and has written books on the subject of a new kind of state, an \"Integral Democracy\". His republican beliefs have kept him somewhat distanced from the AIB, even if they did enjoy his full support in their ideals of dismantling the carcass of the republic as it currently stood. To him, an organic democracy is the conclusion of his studies and ideology, which also changed as the war took a turn for the worse. Now in a position to truly rule and liberate the lands of Vera Cruz from the blight of marxism and liberalism, Mourão leads the newly formed integralist movement in conjunction with similarly minded officers, even if many of the more monarchic elements have been tossed to the wayside, and will do everything in his power to ensure that his political mantra, where the Army, Navy and Paramilitary Militias sustain a united and strong integralist state where faith in God and in the nation are the principles to be maintained, instead of idolatry of wealth and syndicalism."

Was stationed in Santa Catarina during hostilities in 1927, and reached the rank of captain shortly thereafter. He was deeply disillusioned by the lack of immediate change, leading him to later join the integralist movement, having lent public support to some of its more radical figures. Has extensively written against 'liberal-democracy' and marxism alike, and has openly supported and advised in the establishment of integralist militias. A deeply religious and conservative man."

Reached the rank of Captain during the war in 1927, having conspired in favour of the rebels while in Rio before joining their ranks proper, but still too young to be considered a top figure among military circles, especially among the army. Politically conservative and anti-socialist, he has personally led crackdowns against leftist uprisings in Rio de Janeiro more than three times since 1927."

 BRA_julio_marcondes_cesar_salgado_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gJuly 1st, 1890, in Pindamonhangaba, São Paulo, Brazil§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gA member of a distinguished military family dating back to the days of independence, and one of his ancestors was reportedly one of Pedro I's companions at the moment of independence. Júlio joined the army as a cavalry soldier at age 16, and by 1912 had already reached the rank of sergeant, rank of captain by 1924, and after the conflict in 1927 had been named general. A profoundly legalist man, Júlio distinguished himself fighting against insurrections throughout his career, taking barricaded positions by storm in a revolt in Rio in 1923, and had a key role in leading the forces of the State of São Paulo during the war in 1927, where he again performed competently leading local forces, this time against the federal government. He delivered rousing speeches on how São Paulo was not revolting, but upholding republican values that were supposed to maintain the unity of Brazil, and quickly rose to be one of the most famous military men of the entire nation. He is extremely respected especially in São Paulo and among legalist circles in Brazil. While a cavalry officer by career, he is a flexible and modern commander when compared to most of his peers.§!\n\n§YNotes: An avid sportsman, Júlio is state champion of Polo and Fencing, and an expert horse rider, winning a national title in 1928."
 BRA_julio_marcondes_cesar_salgado_leader_desc: "Júlio Marcondes César Salgado was born in Pindamonhangaba. São Paulo, to family with a long tradition in military duty and Paulista politics, he himself a relative of Inácio de Siqueira Salgado, the baron of Itapeva. He has a long service record, started at age 16, and has fought both in the Interstate War and against the ever frequent Syndicalist and Tenentist uprisings in his state, and his veterancy has put him in a condition of being the commander-in-chief and nominal head of state of the newly declared Republic of São Paulo, at least until 'order is properly restored', but few doubt his tenure will hardly be a short one. Having led his state's forces in battle against the rest of Brazil before, Julio isn't exactly phased by the rapid changes brought by the break up of Brazil, and sees São Paulo's freedom as a positive happening for its people. However, unrest is not yet over in the state, and few can predict what foes the new republic might face abroad in such dangerous times."

 BRA_pedro_ventura_felipe_de_araujo_pomar: "Pedro Ventura Felipe de Araújo Pomar"
 BRA_pedro_ventura_felipe_de_araujo_pomar_leader_desc: "Pedro Ventura Felipe de Araújo Pomar lived certainly an unorthodox childhood, having moved to New York from his home state of Pará while aged 5, living there for two years before returning to his small birth town of Obidos, and then moving to the state capital of Belem. He started to act politically at age thirteen, supporting the rebel cause in the interstate war quite publicly, but later on he moved further and further left as he reached adulthood, becoming a full blown socialist by age 20; he spent these youth years studying for medical school, and as a part time footballer for Clube do Remo. A calm and collected man, Pedro often remains quiet in political gatherings, only occasionally inferring in rare points, and has a usually positive and likeable demeanour, which resulted in his relative popularity among trade union members, despite his somewhat young age. Having taken the lead of the entirety of Brazil is one thing, but properly leading the extremely disparate and decentralised factions is another matter entirely. While he calmly believes matters will be sorted shortly and that the revolutionary process will continue smoothly, many wonder if his relative lack of contacts in upper syndicalist circles in major centres of the south may leave him isolated in his own cabinet."
