### World Tension ###

### Ideas ###
 ITA_republic_federation: "The Unstable Republic"
 ITA_republic_federation_desc: "When our nation was saved by Austria in 1920, the Habsburgs forced us to give much power to our constituent states, especially Veneto, as part of the Italian Federation. However, this has been adjourned for six years, effectively disbanded, creating a confusing bureaucratic situation. The opposition also causes no end of trouble, with some calling for the Federation's restoration and some calling for an end to democracy and Austrian influence altogether. The political situation is unlikely to stabilise any time soon."
 ITA_republic_unitary: "The New Unitary Republic"
 ITA_republic_unitary_desc: "The power of the states has been curtailed, and all authority now rests with the central government - a government which has eliminated elections and declared itself above responsibility to the people, for the good of the entire country. While the ANI enjoys a great deal of support, there is still considerable resistance to this new government - particularly from the republicans and old monarchists in the country's former states."
 ITA_federation_transition: "The Federation Restored"
 ITA_federation_transition_desc: "Now that the power of the Federation Council has been restored, we face the long and difficult task of getting the people and civil service to accept as their government what they once thought of as a museum piece."
 ITA_federation_secure: "The Federation Rejuvenated"
 ITA_federation_secure_desc: "The authority of the Federation Council is mostly undisputed, both internationally and internally. The Council now looks to the restitution of its members' former lands."
 ITA_austrian_influence: "Austrian Influence"
 ITA_austrian_influence_desc: "Austria's influence is felt at every level of our nation, from its ownership over many of our companies to the loyalty owed by many of our most highly-placed politicians. Resentment against that influence is high, for even if they have protected us against the syndicalists they are still responsible for our loss in the Weltkrieg. Even so, cutting ties with Austria will prove a difficult and costly task."
 ITA_austrian_sanctions: "Effects of Nationalisation"
 ITA_austrian_sanctions_desc: "Our economy will need time to recover from our so-called 'divorce' from Austrian domination."

ITA_kingdom_crisis: "The Kingdom in Crisis"
ITA_kingdom_crisis_desc: "On a routine ride along in Rome to see their people, Prime Minister Luigi Einaudi and Chancellor Ferruccio Parri were both assasinated by two members of the Socialist Revolutionary Anarchist Party, a lot like King Umberto I of Italy in 1900. They were driving and while waving to the people until suddenly Parri was shot by the first assasin and a bomb was thrown at the car a moment later by the second assasin, killing Einaudi and two civilian passerbys and leaving 14 others wounded. The two men, who go by the names Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti respectively were both gunned down at the site by the military guard who were in the area. The government has not officially came out with any statements about this tragedy yet but it has left a giant power vaccum which must be filled quickly."
### Socialist Paths ###
ITA_socialist_success: "The Revolution Succesful"
ITA_socialist_success_desc: "We have succesfully taken over Italy and fufilled our socialist dreams that were long overdue! The capitalist scum and the old liberal government are now doomed without their leaders. The National Congress is neigh."
### Monarchy Path ###

 ITA_build_legitimacy: "Build Legitimacy"
 ITA_build_legitimacy_desc: "To many, the Italian Federation was no more in their lives than a foreign imposition. They view our government as an irrelevant anachronism that will soon collapse. We must assure them that this is not the case."
 ITA_fight_republicanism: "Fight Republicanism"

 ITA_traditional_values: "Traditional Values"
 ITA_traditional_values_desc: "The revolutionary ideals that have taken hold throughout the world are distasteful and an affront to morality. We must establish ourselves as a bastion of traditionalism in Europe."
 ITA_church_ties: "Church Ties"
 ITA_stable_institutions: "Stable Institutions"
 ITA_stable_institutions_desc: "Though liberals and socialists accuse monarchies and conservative governments of failing to adapt to the times, it is they who act too hastily. We, who have overseen too many changes to count and survived them all, say there is power in traditional institutions, and we shall prove this to the people."

 ITA_create_theistituto_luce: "Create the Istituto Luce"

 ITA_create_paratroopers_desc: "The Arditi represent the best of that Italy has to offer.

 ita.1.t: "The Kingdom of Italy"
 ita.1.d: "Italy came out of the Great War basically as its only victor. With empires collapsing into dust and new countries rising from their ashes, Italy had an open opportunity to take some of its claimed territories including Corsica, Tunisia, Djibouti, Dalmatia, Istria, and Southern Tyrol. After this much political discontent was silenced as the victories of the ruling government were put for show across Italy. Though not all was sunshine and rainbows, however, as moving into the early 20s the Italian economy began to flop as high occupation costs and the giving of cheap and free land to thousands of veterans as part of their promises from the Great War racked up and caused the Rome Panic of 1921. It was a short period but it greatly affected the Italian economy for a couple months. The panic ended once the Italian big business and some loans caused the Italian economy to get back on its feet. Driving into the late 20s was a roaring time to be alive in Italy, the economy began to boom, the gambling and playing and sightseeing and everything was booming and great in Italy, and one other thing that the roaring 20s was known for is the mafia and gang warfare, which also applies to Italy. Now in 1936 Italy is a great place to be, but the mafia still rages in gang warfare in the south of Italy, and many believe that this is just the calm before the storm."

 ITA_italo_balbo: "Italo Balbo"
 ITA_italo_balbo_leader_desc: "Disruptive. Bombastic. Extreme. Violent. But never boring. Few could predict that the Italian Republic, long torn between the aristocratic federation backed by Austria and the democracy backed by idealists, would be toppled by a man who despised both. Atop the ashes, Italo Balbo has declared himself Il Duce before his legionnaires and would not be stopped: not by decency, by threat of revolt, invasion by Austrians, or the red menace to the West.\n\nBalbo grew up near Ferrara, and quickly fell under the spell of romanticism. He admired the heroes of the Risorgimento, particularly Giuseppe Mazzini, and at age 14 attempted to run away to join Ricciotti Garibaldi’s attempt to free Albania from the Ottoman yolk.\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg broke out, he paused his studies and joined the Alpini. He was quickly noted for his courage and fanaticism against the Austrians, gaining multiple awards and the rank of Captain. During the war, he was also first introduced to aircraft: he volunteered for flight training as the tide began to turn against the Entente. Despite the Italians’ best efforts however, they were defeated and an armistice was signed in 1919.\n\nDespite having grown up exposed to Republican and Socialist viewpoints, Balbo developed a hatred for the socialist revolution. After resigning his commission in protest for their surrender to the Austrians, he organised his own militias to crack down on socialist activity. This brought him to the attention of the like-minded Gabriele D'Annunzio, who helped co-found the Italian Nationalist Association.\n\nThe ANI became infamous within the newly founded ‘Italian Federation’ for their violent acts of terrorism against pro-Austrian and pro-Socialist figures. Many landowners turned a blind eye to their activities, and Balbo became infamous as one of D’Annunzio’s enforcers, easily assuming leadership after the former’s death.\n\nNow, having swept away his political opponents, Balbo’s vision of an irredentist, totalitarian and nationalist Italy can be implemented. But whether this is folly or if he truly is the next Mazzini, one thing is for certain: there’s a long way to go."

 ITA_pietro_ferdinando: "Pietro Ferdinando d'Asburgo-Lorena"
 ITA_pietro_ferdinando_leader_desc: "While many in Italy dream of great change, others look back to the past - back when things were different. For many of such nostalgics, they look to Garibaldi or Mazzini, for a time when Italy was strong and united. But, there is a minority that look back even further. It would appear that their dream has come true: Grand Duke Pietro Ferdinando d'Asburgo-Lorena has assumed the title of President of the restored Italian Federation, a collection of pre-Risorgimento Italian states. His ascension is no doubt in part as a reward for Austria’s loyal patronage of Italian aristocrats and conservatives.\n\nPietro Ferdinando was born in Salzburg to the former Grand Duke Ferdinand IV of Tuscany, one of the larger states in Italy. His father had been deposed, and in exile abdicated his claim to the throne in favour of the Austrian Emperor. The third son of his family and given the political circumstances, Pietro Ferdinando did not expect to be restored to Tuscany and enrolled in the Austrian military.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, he served as an infantry commander and aided in the occupation of Northern Italy. As the armistice was first signed, Austrian planners began drafting up plans to restore the old status quo with a small twist: there would be a loose federation led by the Pope to govern Italy and quell Italian nationalistic sentiment. Since his brothers both married morganatically, General Pietro Ferdinand was chosen by Charles to become the new Grand Duke of Tuscany.\n\nThese designs proved to be too ambitious. The Austrian advance never made it to Tuscany, and socialist rebels have overrun the region. Moreover, by 1930 the Federation had collapsed: Sicily and Sardinia left while Austrian troops pulled out of the north. A republic was declared, and Pietro Ferdinand effectively stuck in a legal limbo. At least until now.\n\nTo keep himself entertained, the Hapsburg prince has been known to appreciate the arts. He is distantly related to the House of Bourbon-Parma through his mother’s side."

 ITA_adriano_visconti: "Adriano Visconti"
 ITA_adriano_visconti_leader_desc: "Long ago, the Visconti family ruled over the Duchy of Milan. It would appear that great fortune has allowed for them to return to power and then some: Adriano Visconti, the Austrian installed count of Lombardy, has become the President of the Italian Federation. It is an ironic, perhaps intentional choice - the Milanese were some of the most hostile to Imperial rule over North Italy and the defeat of Austria’s favoured candidate in Pietro Ferdinando of Tuscany could signal a greater degree of independence by this federation from Austrian rule. Perhaps, under this young count and air ace, the Italian Federation will be more than just another Hapsburg puppet state.\n\nThe son of Galeazzo Visconti, Adriano was born during the Weltkrieg in then Italian Libya, but he was still little more than a baby when he returned to Italy. Having joined the Air Force in 1936, amid rising tensions in the peninsula, he has shown remarkable talent as a fighter pilot, and has always seen himself as one. Thrust into the position of count to bring stability to Lombardy, the brash and impetuous young man has little care for diplomatic niceties, or the idea that a Count cannot pilot a fighter plane, but is still loyal and has no intention of skipping the duties of his position, for he has seen from above the consequences of syndicalism and war personally."

 ITA_emilio_de_bono: "Emilio de Bono"
 ITA_emilio_de_bono_leader_desc: "Times have not been very kind to Italy, and it would appear that the life of democracy in the Italian Republic was fleeting. Defeated by foreign powers and with the legacy of Italy’s civil war still fresh on the occupiers’ minds, Emilio de Bono has been tasked with establishing a provisional military government for Italy. Given the circumstances, it would appear that General de Bono will remain in office for some time to come.\n\nEmilio de Bono was born in Lombardy, a distant descendant of Lombardy nobility. He followed in his father’s footsteps and enrolled in military school, studying at Milan and then Modena. An officer in the Bersaglieri, de Bono fought in Eritrea and Libya during the high period of the new Italian kingdom, a time that sadly could not last.\n\nWhen Italy fatefully cast their lot with the Entente in 1915, the then Colonel de Bono was sent to fight against the Austrians. Promoted quickly to Major General and leader of the ‘Trapani’ brigade, de Bono distinguished himself and became a decorated officer. During the defence of Mount Grappa at the waning days of the war, de Bono co-wrote the Canzone del Grappa which became a patriotic song despite Italy’s ultimate defeat.\n\nIndeed, things began to change quickly after 1918. De Bono was captured when Italy’s front lines began to collapse and watched in captivity as Italy rapidly divided into civil war. Austrian authorities, desperate to stabilise their deteriorating hold in northern Italy, had de Bono released with his men to serve in Italy’s White Army against the red tide. The ensuing awkward arrangement between the Federation and the Republic did not affect de Bono’s new career - he briefly became Director General of Public Security in Bonomi’s government during the early days as the situation stabilised in Lombardy and Venetia. Despite a controversial term, which included the high profile murders of political dissidents, he nonetheless became a Marshal of Italy.\n\nNow, with a new government installed, de Bono is seen as an elderly figurehead for foreign rule. While many have criticised him for his heavy handed policies and he has been accused of being sympathetic to Balbo and his legionnaires, the new military government is nonetheless expected to keep lumbering on."

 ITA_giovanni_gronchi: "Giovanni Gronchi"
 ITA_giovanni_gronchi_leader_desc: "In a country dominated by Roman Catholics, it was perhaps no surprise when Giovanni Gronchi and the Italian’s People’s Party (PPI) took charge of the young Italian Republic. This coalition, dominated by Christian Democrats, promises to guide the Italian nation using Christian social teachings - contrasting with anti-clerical factions on the left while still promoting welfare and labor issues opposed by the right.\n\nThe man at the helm of the PPI is Giovanni Gronchi, a Tuscan-born follower of Father Romolo Murri, one of the early founders of Christian democracy in Italy. Initially a highschool teacher with a degree in literature from the University of Pisa, when the Weltkrieg broke out Gronchi fought as an infantry officer. \n\nWhen the war ended, Giovanni Gronchi returned as a decorated soldier to a deteriorating political situation at home. Fearful of anti-Catholic violence, he fled Tuscany and went to Milan. There, Father Luigi Sturzo began to organise the PPI for the first time with the blessing of Rome and Vienna. Unlike the other Christian Democratic parties emerging in post-civil war Italy, the PPI found themselves under a Republic and proved to be comfortable serving both under the Austrian imposed federation and Bonomi’s republican system.\n\nGronchi’s activities as a PPI activist and representative have been varied. In addition to being a reasonably successful businessman, industrialist and salesperson, he was also notable for helping organise Catholic trade unions in an effort to undercut syndicalist influence and win better concessions for the workers. One of the more left-leaning members of the PPI, his ascension into leadership was not a sure thing. When Luigi Sturzo resigned as leader of the PPI, Gronchi took power as part of a triumvirate with Giulio Rodinò and Giuseppe Spataro. Together they formed a front against the rising Legionairism in Italy, hoping to organise the remaining democratic parties against them.\n\nGronchi’s election as President of Italy now confirms the influence of the PPI in Italian politics. While some have criticised him for actions seen as conciliatory to socialists and syndicalists, his commitment to parliamentary democracy and his willingness to engage in some economic reform makes him a stable candidate to guide Italy for the near future."

 ITA_luigi_einaudi: "Luigi Einaudi"
 ITA_luigi_einaudi_leader_desc: "Sometimes, despite all the chaos and all rapid changes engulfing a nation, it is easier to go back to the way things used to be. The triumph of the Italian Liberal Party is proof of that fact, and with the reemergence of the dominant party of the early 1900s, it would appear that the status quo of old has returned. But not everything is the same - Luigi Einaudi is a new man promising a new day in Italy. Under his careful eye, liberalism will flourish in Italy and will be more than just a capitalistic vehicle for political control. Rather, it will be an expansive ideology reflecting integrated approach to moral, economic and social reasoning.\n\nBorn in 1874 to a small town in Piedmont to a minor bureaucratic family, Einaudi was orphaned at age 14. He went to school in Turin, studying economics under Salvatore Cognetti de Martiis. A socialist in university and a collaborator with Critica Sociale, his time as a magazine contributor ended with a move towards liberal thought. He spent a significant portion of his life in academia, teaching finance at schools in Turin and Milan.\n\n1919 changed everything, not just for Italy but also for a young Einaudi. The middle aged professor found himself at Bocconi University in occupied Milan as socialist and nationalist revolutionaries began to overrun major cities and towns across the country. With many of his students dropping out to join a cause, Einaudi became inspired to find a movement of his own. He was introduced to national politics by Francesco Saverio Nitti during the chaotic early days of the Italian Federation, and soon became an outspoken member of the PLI. \n\nAlthough Nitti remained with the Sicilian government after the Federation collapsed, Einaudi stayed with Federation leadership in Lombardy and joined the Republican government. He helped to reorganise the liberals, rallying them against the aristocratic influence of the Austrians and their Federationist allies as well as the nationalistic legionaires under Balbo. Instead, he has chosen to offer a vision of an Italy with the utmost respect for human liberty and encouraging the individual to pursue a form of self actualisation away from the dominance of the state. He also dreams of a European federalism, distinct from the false and exploitative ‘federation’ imposed by the Hapsburgs, one where European peoples work together to keep the red tide at bay and to promote individual civil liberties across the continent."

 ITA_marcello_soleri: "Marcello Soleri"
 ITA_marcello_soleri_leader_desc: "Even as times change and politicians come and go, it can be reassuring for many that a familiar face is at the helm. Marcello Soleri is one of those faces, a long time political figure in the Italian Liberal Party from even before the Weltkrieg. Before the chaos that engulfed Italy. His vision for Italy marks a return to the old, liberal dominated order - challenging the Catholics to the right and the socialists to the left.\n\nSoreli was born in Cuneo, a small town near Turin. His parents were active in local politics, and instilled a powerful sense of duty into their sons. After studying at the University of Turin and receiving a degree in law, funded in significant amounts by family friends such as Giovanni Giolitti, Soleri became a part time journalist and a lawyer.\n\nHis early career was marked by a leftist turn, admiring socialists and joining a Masonic Lodge. However, he remained connected to Giolitti - a Liberal party grandee - and helped him campaign to rally moderate Christian opposition to socialism. Soleri became a mayor of Cuneo at age 30 in 1912 as the leader of a liberal-democratic coalition. He began an aggressive job-creating infrastructure development scheme, but transitioned to national politics within a year or so.\n\nAs a member of the chamber of deputies, Soleri frequently broke with the Liberal party, especially when it came to intervention in the Weltkrieg. Initially a ‘neutralist’, he joined the Alpini infantry corps as a second lieutenant. He was wounded towards the end of the war, which took him out of the fighting as the Italian front collapsed around him.\n\nAs Ivanoe Bonomi worked to establish a stable government in the civil war, Soleri was invited to become a finance minister. He worked to lower the heavy taxation imposed on the people during the Weltkrieg and civil war, which he saw as choking Italian business. Suspicious of Austrian influence, the Aristocratic Federationists, Socialists and the rising Legionnaires, Soleri worked to minimise these influences while avoiding any direct challenges that would destabilise the state.\n\nRecently, the ascent of the Liberals have propelled Soleri to leadership of the Italian Republic. Now a seasoned politician, it is up to him to ensure that the republic and its leading party remains on top of the challenges ahead."

 ITA_ivanoe_bonomi: "Ivanoe Bonomi"
 ITA_ivanoe_bonomi_leader_desc: "Traitor. Sellout. Puppet. Failure. Ivanoe Bonomi has heard it all, but he still diligently fights every day for Italy and the Republic. Being a Prime Minister isn’t an easy job for most countries, and certainly not in a divided Italy. When the Sicilians and Sardinians withdrew from the Italian Federation in 1930, then Prime Minister of the Federation Bonomi dissolved the Federation, a bold move that established a new republic and sidelined the foreign-raised monarchs nominally ruling Italy. Subsequently, he was elected Prime Minister of the new Italian Republic, and his willingness to work with the much-maligned Austria, while economically beneficial, continues to draw great internal scrutiny. Bonomi struggles to weather these increasingly virulent criticisms while cementing the republic's political institutions.\n\nIt would be unwise, however, to write off Bonomi as just another Austrian collaborator or political suit. The father of this new Italian Republic actually had his origins as a socialist deputy from Mantua. Born 1873, a generation after first Risorgimento, he grew up a scholar and a journalist as Italy transitioned from a wartime state to a new Kingdom. His moderate views and support for Giolotti’s war in Libya saw him expelled from the PSI in 1912, and opted to co-found the Italian Socialist Reformist Party (PSRI).\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg began, he volunteered to go to the front. After a short stint however, he quickly assumed a series of high ranking cabinet positions, with portfolios including Public Works, War, and Treasury. With many other Italian politicians fleeing into exile or retiring from politics in 1919 after the humiliating armistice, Ivanoe Bonomi was one of the few who dared to remain in the government as the Austrians began drafting their peace terms. The deteriorating political situation saw Italy collapse into civil war and Austrian occupation of northern Italy. \n\nRealising things have gone out of control and in a desperate bid to attract some liberal support, the Austrians allowed Bonomi to form a compromise provisional democratic government in Milan parallel to their Aristocratic federation project. Bonomi, for his part, dropped his openly socialist views in favour of joining the newly formed Liberal Democrats.\n\nHaving outflanked the Austrians for now, it is up to Bonomi to navigate the treacherous waters ahead if his Republic is to survive."

 ITA_ferruccio_parri: "Ferruccio Parri"
 ITA_ferruccio_parri_leader_desc: "As one star fades, another rises in its place. After decades of leadership under Ivanoe Bonomi, the Liberal Democrats have emerged renewed under Ferruccio Parri. With the support of a wider coalition, Parri hopes for a new era of unity in a tumultuous Italy.\n\nInitially a school teacher in Milan and an editor at Corriere della Sera, the Weltkrieg changed Parri’s life forever. Joining as an officer, he was decorated for bravery and was wounded on three separate occasions throughout the war. During the closing days of the war, he was an officer of the Italian General Staff, and was dismayed as the Italian military suffered defeat after defeat at the hands of the combined Austro-German offensive.\n\nParri was part of the Italian military remnant released by the Austrians to help stabilise the situation in the Italian homefront as Italian revolutionaries deposed the monarchy and sought to oust the Austrians from the peninsula. While suspicious of Austrian aims, he feared the rising tide of socialism and used his influence in Milan to organise partisan groups to counter red infiltration. He became moderately known locally for being a staunchly republican editor of the Corriere della Sera, promoting a liberal democratic alternative to syndicalism.\n\nInitially lukewarm towards the Italian Federation imposed by the Austrians, he became an avid supporter of Bonomi’s Italian Republic when it was declared in 1930. By that point, he was a manager of Milan’s largest electrical company and joined up with Bonomi’s newly formed Liberal Democrats.\n\nNow, it is up to Parri to take up the torch of the party and safeguard the democratic, moderate ideals of the Republic."

 ITA_carlo_rosselli: "Carlo Rosselli"
 ITA_carlo_rosselli_leader_desc: "Not every socialist felt comfortable in the SRI. Carlo Rosselli is a self-described ‘Liberal Socialist’, who broke off from the initial Socialist revolution in the 1920s to join the Republic. Although lacking in a mass following, the rapid changes in the post-Black Monday order has propelled Rosselli into power.\n\nBorn in Rome to a wealthy Tuscan family, he was influenced by his mother, a prominent Italian republican. He spent time studying in Vienna and then Florence, struggling in his academics. Still a student at the start of the Weltkrieg, Carlo joined his brothers in supporting the intervention. He worked to help publish propaganda pieces with Il nostro programma, including a manifesto promoting Mazzinian ideals and humanitarian love. Rosselli went to war as an officer with the Alpini in 1918 and was forced to fight during the retreat from Austro-German advances.\n\nAs the situation in Italy spiraled into civil war, Rosselli grew enamored by Syndicalism and even joined the budding Italian Socialist Party. He studied at the University of Siena and became an editor at the Critica Sociale. He also took time to visit and work in France. However, as the Italian civil war ground to a halt and political paranoia grew, suspicion fell upon the upper class Rosselli. Indeed, Rosselli himself had begun to distance himself from Marxism, brazenly publishing Socialisme Liberal in 1930 - a critique of Marxism, authoritarianism within socialism, and calling for a synthesis of democratic socialism and Italian liberalism.\n\nThis made him deeply unpopular within Italian circles, and he realised he was persona non grata when militants attacked his home. Rosselli fled from France to the newly formed Italian Republic. There, he has amassed a following with his ideas. Many within the Republic see him as too idealistic for such a violent period, and his former comrades in the Socialist Republic see him as a traitor. But Carlo Rosselli is determined to bring about his vision of a libertarian socialist Italy."
 
 ITA_victor_emmanuel_iii: "Victor Emmanuel III"
 ITA_victor_emmanuel_iii_leader_desc: "The Soldier King people call him. Victor Emmanuel III is a national icon of Italy, resembling courage, bravery, and prosperity. He’s the person who puts King in the kingdom of Italy. Literally. He was born on the 11th of November 1869 in Naples, after his father assassination he rose to the throne at the year 1900, and he showed that he was a man of constitutional monarchy, being a staunch defender of the freedoms of his people. He had also shown that he is a hater of politicial issues, but despite being a reluctantly political king he has his political powers and used them on many occasions to help Italy. During The Great War, he denied the resignation of then prime minister Antonio Salandra despite the Chamber of Deputies trying to get him out of office, dooming his country to entry in The Great War on the side of the Entente. And his reign saw his country virtually the only real victor of the Great War apart from his Greek allies. This won Victor Emmanuel the title Soldier King by the people, and his popularity was solidified. Victor guided Italy through the Rome Panic and into the late 20s, his popularity gradually growing in unison with the Italian economy. Today in 1936, Italy stands at a economic stagnation, but with Victor Emmanuel III at the head of Italy, he is pretty much guaranteed the title Soldier King."
