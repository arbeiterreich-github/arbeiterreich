 PRE_wilhelm_iii: "Wilhelm von Preußen"
 PRE_wilhelm_iii_regnal: "Wilhelm III"
 PRE_wilhelm_iii_leader_desc: "Formerly heir apparent of the German Empire since the age of six, Wilhelm III was a decorated commander in the Imperial German Army in his own right. A royal who presents an air of modernity and military discipline in spite of his numerous affairs, a competent equestrian and a student of administrative law, he began his career in the army in 1911, commissioned to command the 1st Life Hussar Regiment. When the Weltkrieg began, he rose to command the 5th Army, and then the Army Group Kronprinz Wilhelm, despite his young age and lack of military experience. His influence in decision-making on the front was minimal, however, and Wilhelm instead used the prestige of his position to support Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff - he described the ousting of Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg as "the most beautiful day of his life".\n\nWilhelm returned from the Western Front a war hero and continued his duties as the heir apparent. In the post-war years, he has retained his position in the Army, while growing increasingly close with the German right wing - especially Kurt von Schleicher, who is a friend and ally of his. Assuming the throne after the passing of his father, Wilhelm III stokes concern in democrats and raises sneers among foreign diplomats who expect him to patronise militarists and expansionists, and thus has a lot to prove."

 PRE_wilhelm_iv: "Wilhelm IV"
 PRE_wilhelm_iv_leader_desc: "Born in 1906, Wilhelm IV is the oldest son of Crown Prince Wilhelm and grandson of the famous Wilhelm II. The Weltkrieg passed his life while he was merely a child, and so he grew up and gained an education in the modern, parliamentarised postwar Empire. To an average German monarchist, Wilhelm II was mostly associated with his prewar scandals, media blunders and incapacity to lead during the Weltkrieg, while the Crown Prince earned disdain due to his playboy attitude and involvement with the far right - so, they held their hopes in the second in line for the throne, the Crown Prince's son.\n\nDespite being presented throughout the interwar as a "modern Hohenzollern" who is able to transcend rigid class boundaries, Wilhelm avoided involving himself in politics at all. Though he participated in a few public groups as a honorary member, he generally stayed focused on sports, student clubs, and military service. Yet, over time, he began to show considerable political acumen, and became genuinely popular as time went on - his popularity grew even further during the Second Weltkrieg, when he served in the Heer as a lieutenant with distinction. As the new German Emperor, Wilhelm IV brings this experience to the field, and intends to not repeat the mistakes of his father and grandfather."

 PRE_gerd_von_rundstedt: "Gerd von Rundstedt"
 PRE_gerd_von_rundstedt_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gDecember 12th, 1875, in Aschersleben, Province of Saxony, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gBorn to a dynasty of Prussian nobility whose men all served in the military since Frederick the Great, Gerd von Rundstedt did not stray from this tradition - his path since maturity strayed little from the ordinary Prussian noble officer, first the Kadettenanstalt Oranienstein, then Royal Prussian Main Cadet Institute at Groß-Lichterfelde, in Berlin. Commissioned as an infantry officer, he made a good impression on his superiors for outstanding ability and so began to climb the ranks. At the beginning of the Weltkrieg, he was the 22nd Division's Chief of Staff - throughout the course of the war, he saw little action, mostly serving in various staff positions, but with a high reputation among his peers.\n\nAfter the war, he used this good impression and connections to climb the ranks again, ultimately reaching the rank of Generaloberst. A competent and experienced commander respected by pretty much everyone in the General Staff, von Rundstedt is also perhaps the most apolitical - no matter what the topic or issue may be, his view is that the Army must stay out of any political affairs. After all, Prussian field marshals never mutiny."

 PRE_rupprecht_von_bayern: "Rupprecht von Bayern"
 PRE_rupprecht_von_bayern_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gMay 18th, 1869, in Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gThe incumbent King of Bavaria, Rupprecht Maria Luitpold Ferdinand, is also one of the most decorated commanders of the Imperial German Army during the Weltkrieg. Trained as an infantry officer in the Bavarian Army, he eventually rose to command the Bavarian I Army Corps, all while travelling extensively, taking up carpentry, and fulfilling his duties as a prince of the Bavarian royal family. In 1913, he became the heir apparent of the Kingdom, and a year later, he was assigned to lead the German Sixth Army during the Schlieffen Plan. Though his assignment was made due to his royal status, he proved to be an able and innovative commander. At the same time, however, he used his military command to push for Bavarian interests - refusing to withdraw his army from the Western Front to defend Prussia and thus forcing the General Staff to move troops from Belgium instead.\n\nIn July 1916, he was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall and was assigned to command the Army Group Rupprecht, a rank he has held onto until today. In 1921, after the passing of his father, Ludwig III of Bavaria, Rupprecht was crowned as the new King of Bavaria, and since then reigns as a constitutional monarch with respect for the laws and institutions of his homeland. Though having to occupy two chairs at once may seem exhausting for some, the King seems none worse for wear, and dutifully awaits Germany's next great war."

 PRE_august_von_mackensen: "August von Mackensen"
 PRE_august_von_mackensen_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gDecember 6th, 1849, in Leipnitz, Province of Saxony, Kingdom of Prussia§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gThe oldest general in the Imperial German Army, known as 'the Last Hussar', August Mackensen came from a middle-class upbringing in rural Prussia. His father, an agricultural administrator, hoped for his son to follow the same career path, but he instead volunteered for the Prussian army and served with distinction in the Franco-Prussian War. In the years following the war, Mackensen broke expectations one after the other, bypassing the three-year preparation period for the General Staff and later serving as an adjutant to Wilhelm II himself, the first commoner to do so. On the Kaiser's 40th birthday, he was ennobled, becoming August von Mackensen, and was assigned to command XVII Army Corps - a prestigious position, as Crown Prince Wilhelm now served under him.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, he was one of Germany's most successful and prestigious commanders, assigned to front after front in Europe - Galicia, Serbia, and finally Romania, shattering Entente resistance in all three campaigns. He returned to Germany a war hero and a Generalfeldmarschall, and continued to serve in the Army thenceforth. By now, however, von Mackensen is over eighty years old, his sharpness has dulled and his body is no longer as able as it once was - most assume retirement is coming soon, the only thing that matters is when."

 PRE_erich_von_manstein: "Erich von Manstein"
 PRE_erich_von_manstein_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gNovember 24th, 1887, in Berlin, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gBorn as von Lewinski, Erich von Manstein comes from the family of a noble Prussian general with Kashubian heritage, and is the nephew of Paul von Hindenburg. Much like the rest of his extended family, he followed a career in the military. After six years in the cadet corps in Plön and Groß-Lichterfelde, he was commissioned into the Third Foot Guards Regiment - and reached the Weltkrieg as an infantry lieutenant enrolled in the Prussian War Academy. The war put an end to his studies and sent him to the front - both East and West, to several fronts and several world-renown campaigns, ending with the victorious march into France in 1919.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Manstein remained in the army and continued climbing the ranks, having shown his talent and intelligence in the years prior. As a newly inducted member of the General Staff, he toured countries across Europe to study their military facilities and breakthroughs in new tactics, all while developing his own. Regarded as an innovative commander with a knack for unorthodox strategies, he is one of the main proponents of combined arms, mobile warfare in the German army."
