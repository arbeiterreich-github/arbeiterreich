 CHI_totalist_party: "KMT-CRS"
 CHI_totalist_party_long: "China Reconstruction Society (Zhōngguó guómíndăng zhōnghuá fùxīng shè)\n\n§LThe China Reconstruction Society (CRS) is a clique formed by radical officers of the National Revolutionary Army and holds close ties with Dai Chunfeng's Zhongteju. Led primarily by Hu Zongnan, He Zhonghan, and Deng Wenyi, the CRS emerged as a new political faction following the First National Congress and is especially popular amongst the military's young guard.\n\nTheir ideology consists of a host of influences from far-right Savinkovism to Maximist British economic planning, but the Sorelian necessity of violence most inspires them. The CRS sees the complex bureaucratic nature of the Kuomintang to be the party's downfall and wishes to see the party purged of its democratic elements - with the end goal of a party led by a glorious dictator (the lingxiu). From there, they envision China to be developed into a highly militarised and equal society with the notion and ideas of class struggle eradicated in favour of a complete totalitarian and socialist nation. They look to China's antiquity and its Confucian order of old as not elements of ancient history but rather a sense of halcyon tranquillity that will eventually be achieved under the rule of the benevolent lingxiu. If China is to be saved, if she is to be liberated, and if she is to become a respected mighty power once more - she will have to be reconstructed from the ground up.§!\n"

 CHI_radical_socialist_party: "KMT-RCA"
 CHI_radical_socialist_party_long: "Reorganised Comrades Association of the Kuomintang (Zhōngguó guómíndăng gaizu tóngzhì huì)\n\n§LWhen the Kuomintang's left-wing dominated Central Committee fled to Europe following the end of the Northern Expedition, most left-wingers joined the Kuomintang Reorganised Comrades Association (RCA). The RCA, led primarily by Chen Gongbo, but including the closest friends and followers of Wang Jingwei - believes that if the revolution is to be saved, it must be reorganised in the same spirit as 1924. The Kuomintang, in their eyes, must be purged of its excess democratic and reactionary forces; only then will China achieve her national revolution.\n\nOnce a secret faction amongst the Chinese expatriate community in Europe, with the return of the Central Committee, the RCA has emerged as one of the Kuomintang's two major political parties. They adhere to a model of strict leadership (seeing the Kuomintang as the vanguard of the socialist revolution) and a party for the peasantry, workers, and petite bourgeoisie. They hold warm and cordial ties with the Third Internationale, and many RCA members also hold relations with the Chinese Syndicalist Party. Nonetheless, it is a movement that sees the Chinese Nationalist cause as not just one for China but also one for the entirety of Asia. The RCA runs on a platform that China is the socialist vanguard, spreading the revolution far and wide and liberating the oppressed peoples of Asia from the chains of imperialism. The RCA consists of two wings - the radical wing led by Chen Gongbo and a moderate wing led by Gu Mengyu - with their views differing over issues such as the class base of the party or land reform.§!\n"

 CHI_syndicalist_party: "CSP"
 CHI_syndicalist_party_long: "Chinese Syndicalist Party (Zhōngguó gōng tuán dăng)\n\n§LThe Chinese Syndicalist Party does not belong to the Kuomintang, even though many of its members hold close ties and believe in the \"Sun Yat-sen\" model of revolution. Nonetheless, they are allowed to participate in the Kuomintang's National Revolution as part of the Kuomintang's agreement with the Third Internationale for support.\n\nNonetheless, the CSP's movements and organisation are primarily confined to China's urban centres, such as the ports of the Legation Cities. As a result, their movement is broken and fragmented with nominal leadership ascribed to Chen Duxiu, who adheres to a more orthodox strain of syndicalism and advocates for a united front with his party and the Kuomintang. However, more radical syndicalist Chinese intellectuals, such as Wang Ming's so-called \"28 Syndicalists\" in France, adhere to the idea of the CSP as the sole carrier of revolution. The CSP is, therefore, viewed as both a foreign and a domestic threat by more conservative members of the Kuomintang, and their presence represents a potentially uneasy relationship with the Internationale.§!\n"

 CHI_social_democrat_party: "KMT-PAC"
 CHI_social_democrat_party_long: "Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang (Zhōngguó guómíndăng línshí xíngdòng wěiyuánhuì)\n\n§LThe Provisional Action Committee was formed during the League War by those who supported Song Qingling and distrusted the authoritarian nature of the returned Central Committee led by Wang Jingwei. Believing in the notion of achieving total socialism by the workers and the peasantry, the PAC draws its name from its desire for the Kuomintang to take action as a revolutionary vanguard with the masses gaining revolutionary consciousness and taking action as well.\n\nThe main ideological facets of the PAC is a total social revolution through democratic land reform to reward the land to those who till it, the installation of local self-governments as a result, and the necessity for China to adopt a method of \"National Capitalism\" to transition China from a feudal society into a socialist one. They see the Third Internationale as a temporary ally but view the Internationale nations as one of suspicion and are generally hostile to working with the Chinese Syndicalist Party. As one of the two major political cliques in the Kuomintang, the PAC seeks to enlighten the masses of China and transform the Chinese proletariat into a force of revolutionary change to entirely defeat the warlords, expel the imperialists, and fulfil the dream of Sun Yat-sen.§!\n"

As a result, many of these party members come from Hawaii, the United States, or Southeast Asia and represent the greater international diaspora of the Chinese community. They are ideologically not socialist but regard themselves as the party's centre-left wing and are known for their inclination towards democracy.§!\n"

As a result, they are hardly relevant to the Kuomintang but they represent republicans who support the platform of anti-imperialism and anti-warlordism but nonetheless, are not nominal members of the Kuomintang.§!\n"

These elderly statesmen of the Kuomintang once were anarchists and had studied in France, where they helped encourage the development of the Work-Study programme. They represent the Kuomintang's Old Guard and had supported the revolution since its very beginnings - as such, they are effectively the party's \"genro\". Frequently sought after by major political players in the Kuomintang for favours or advice, they are known to be fiercely anti-syndicalist.§!\n"

 CHI_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Shanghai Cliques\n\n§LRepresenting Kuomintang interests or political allies from the big businesses of the Shanghai Bund to the shadowy red-light district alleys of Shanghai's slums, the Kuomintang holds relations and communications with these organisations in the hopes of securing Nationalist support and influence in the Legation Cities. While linked to Central Committee members from Chen Gongbo to Zhang Renjie, they represent a source of financial and political support for the Kuomintang to be recognised as a national revolutionary movement.§!\n"

They are also heavily influenced by the right-wing ideologue of the Kuomintang, Dai Jitao; they are considered to be the far-right of the Kuomintang. As a result, their presence is non-existent within the Kuomintang.

It sees its goals as not just a social revolution for China but also a nationalistic revolution and a democratic revolution - one that genuinely aims to liberate the oppressed masses of the land and to bring the notion of democracy to China.

The notorious 'Hooded Chairman' of the KMT, Dai Chunfeng rose to power first as a minor protegé of the late Marshal Chiang Kai-shek, and then through his leadership of the ZhongTeJu. Devoted to a very personal interpretation of the Kuomintang's mission to unify and revive China, Dai and his allies seized control of the Nationalist government after a long-standing period of instability made it clear that there was no alternative but the KMT's security apparatus taking the helm of state. As shy of the public spotlight as he is ruthless, Dai is very rarely seen in public, but is known to be an indulgent playboy of a kind when off-duty."

 CHI_dai_chunfeng_desc: "§YAdvisor Description\nBorn:§! §gMarch 28th, 1897, in Zhejiang, Qing Empire§!\n§YPolitical Career:§! §gVarious stories explain how the silent yet ambitious protegé of Chiang Kai-shek came to the Kuomintang. Some say that he was introduced to the Whampoa Military Academy by one of its leading members of the KMT right, Dai Jitao - others say he was introduced by his friend Mao Rendang. The "laoban" of the ZhongTeju has never revealed his origins and following his shady character - most likely never will.\n\nBorn in Zhejiang, Dai lived a rough life amidst the dim lights of Shanghai's filthiest underground quarters. Until 1923, he was mentored by the leader of the Axe Gang, Wang Yaqiao. A skilled gambler, it was here in Shanghai where he met Du Yusheng - head of the Green Gang and an associate of Chiang Kai-shek's. From there, he entered Whampoa's Sixth Class and became a favourite of Chiang's, helping Chiang keep an eye on subversive elements within the party's left-wing.\n\nWhen the Northern Expedition failed, Dai fled to the Legation Cities, where he continued his underground criminal activities. As such, he was able to develop an incredibly complex intelligence organisation, due to his already established networks in the underground - some regard his intelligence agency as perhaps the largest in China. For years, he had been coordinating activities with Song Qingling's insurgent zone, and upon the return of the Central Committee - he was ready to meet them with open arms...§!"

 CHI_dai_chunfeng_sic_desc: "§YAdvisor Description\nBorn:§! §gMarch 28th, 1897, in Zhejiang, Qing Empire§!\n§YPolitical Career:§! §gWhen outsiders peer into the new hardliner government of the Republic of China, intelligence officers, academics and \"Old China hands\" often debate who is truly holding the reins. At the top of course is the Lingxiu, the leader the Chinese Reconstruction Society claim to follow unquestioningly: Generalissimo Hu Zongnan. But between him and his millions of followers, things grow murky. Ostensibly, the Premier of the Executive Branch (the somewhat equivalent to Prime Minister), Sun Fo, would be his chief deputy. But no one really buys that narrative. Others claim Hu is the figurehead of a wider NRA junta with Deng Wenyi and He Zhonghan or that he is under the sway of the so-called Four Elders of the Party.\n\nNo one, it appears, seems to realise the truth, and that's the way Dai Chunfeng prefers it. A minor protégé of Chiang Kai-shek, the second half of the Republic's leading duumvirate rules from the shadows-relying on his close friendship with Hu Zongnan, a powerful intelligence apparatus, and extensive connections with the criminal underworld.\n\nThis mysterious political operator, the "laoban" of the Zhongteju, cultivates a small cult-like following of his own within his fiefdom. Dai insists on an utter dedication to the Chinese nation and a staunchly Confucian morality despite his own prior affiliation with the Shanghai underground. Agents are forbidden from gambling and smoking, and are expected to be celibate - all for the sake of China.\n\nAlthough by day Hu Zongnan and the army boisterously rule China, the CRS march to the tune of national regeneration and the civilian leadership keep along the best they can, everyone knows to some extent that in the darkness all are watched by the Zhongteju.§!"

A lifelong experience of failing his Confucian exams taught Chen Duxiu one thing - that the old order had to go. Centuries of archaic decrepit institutions from the perfidious Manchus simply clogged the progression of mankind, especially in regard to the Marxist interpretation of history.\n\nIn 1915, he would go on to found the popular journal "New Youth" and joined fellow leftist educator Cai Yuanpei in Beijing where both men lashed out against the perceived backwardness of China and the necessity for a new model, a new method to allow China to enter the modern age and reassert herself in the world once more. In Beijing, he was attracted to Li Dazhao's Marxist study group and when word broke out of the revolution in France in 1919, Chen Duxiu believed that a syndicalist model was China's natural progression in the Marxist historical materialist model - that the workers and peasants of Chinese society would lead the revolution against the corrupt bourgeoisie and feudal warlords that were leading China to ruin. As such in 1921, Chen Duxiu and other prominent socialist leaders gathered in Shanghai to proclaim the Chinese Syndicalist Party (CSP).\n\nWhen the Kuomintang rose up in 1923, the Commune of France's recognition of the Kuomintang was granted only on the condition that the Kuomintang accept the CSP as a junior partner in the national revolution. Given the CSP's small size and lack of popular support among the rural peasantry and petit bourgeoisie, Chen Duxiu naturally accepted. However, when the Northern Expedition ended in failure in 1927, the Chinese Syndicalist Party fled alongside the Kuomintang. Chen Duxiu headed for a life of secrecy and exile, changing locations frequently from friendly Guangdong to the narrow alleyways of Shanghai's red-light districts.\n\n Against the odds, the Syndicalist Party of China has come to power and a new era dawns for the Chinese workers. As Chen Duxiu takes up the mantle of leadership, no doubt the disagreements and factionalism that have arisen in the exile will come to the surface as the CSP calls to convene. And while the CSP has unified the country under the banner of syndicalism, it was only due to the aid of a foreign nation -but a victory nonetheless, as Chen Duxiu's visions for China slowly become reality."

In his youth, Wang Jingwei was enamoured with the lives of Saigo Takamori and Katsu Kaishu, seeing them as model men who transformed Japan from a backwater into an industrial nation. How can it be that China is so stagnant, he wondered - turning to the works of Liang Qichao and Sun Yat-sen. In the latter, he saw a beloved mentor, and in Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui, he exploded into national prominence when he attempted to assassinate the Zaifeng regent (father of Emperor Puyi), although he failed and was imprisoned.\n\nWhen the Xinhai Revolution broke out, Wang was freed, but he refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the disillusioned Sun, who had found himself sidelined by national politics and the warlords. He instead travelled to France but returned shortly when Sun returned to Guangzhou in 1921 to participate in the newly revived revolutionary government. Wang was present at the party's reorganisation in 1924 and it was here that he began to represent the party's leftist wing, although he hardly fancied himself as a socialist ideologue. When Sun died in 1925, it was Wang that was present on his deathbed in writing his will.\n\nThe triumvirate of Hu Hanmin, Chiang Kai-shek, and Wang Jingwei quickly became one of Kuomintang's most contested and bitter power struggles. However, following Hu Hanmin's assassination in 1925 and Chiang Kai-shek's assassination following the failure of the Northern Expedition, Wang finally achieved his birthright of becoming Sun's rightful successor. But the collapse of the expedition forced him and his closest political allies to flee to Europe in the hopes of one day returning to carry out Sun's will. In exile, he has emerged as the de-facto leader of the Kuomintang's Central Committee, far and often distant from the Jiangfu insurgency on the mainland.\n\nAt last, he has returned and claimed his birthright as Chairman of the Kuomintang. With a cadre of loyal supporters in his time and exile and his pragmatic desires to work with his syndicalist allies, Wang will have to be ruthless and willing - if he is to secure the position of Dr. Sun's rightful successor."

And then came the Northern Expedition, in which she participated in the Northern Expedition, untouchable and unchallenged by anyone within the Kuomintang due to her status as the widow of the great Dr. Sun. But when the expedition failed, she refused to see it as the revolution's failure.

Following the failure of the Northern Expedition, Chen, like many others in the left wing of the party, fled to the Commune of France.\n\nWithin the party's radical wing, he has often been identified as its "chief ideologue," and indeed, many wonder how much sway he has with a close friend and de facto leader of the Kuomintang, Wang Jingwei.\n\nHistory according to Chen Gongbo flows in matter and motion, the two of which Chen believes are the driving force behind human progress. It is only inevitable that just as historical materialism shows, the Reorganisation of the Kuomintang is merely the natural scientific progression of the Chinese National Revolution. Chen's views are Marxist, as shown in his recently published work "Revelations in Chinese History" and his newspaper "The Revolutionary Critic." To the ever-so-pretentious Chen, the Kuomintang must be the revolutionary vanguard, and its ranks must be filled with determined comrades willing to purge and "reorganise" the party along correct ideological lines. From there, the one-party state will reorganise the workers and peasants of the country into economic producers of society - with the eventual goal of utopian socialist economic cooperatives in both the agricultural and urban sectors of the country. He envisions a China built from the ground up by the workers and for the workers, one that will finally break the chains of western imperialism by pursuing its native capital with the help of the state. As such, economically he does support the confiscation of land by force through the peasantry should the landlords not accept government intervention. With Wang's consolidation of rule following the First Repatriated Congress of the Kuomintang, Chen emerged as the premier leader of the RCA's radical wing - with his advice and loyalty ever so valued by the Chairman.§!"

Zhou's intellect and charisma helped him secure the highly famous Nankai Middle School - where he caught the eye of the school's founder, the scholar Zhang Boling.\n\nGradating from Nankai as one of its two valedictorians; Zhou travelled to Japan in 1917 to pursue further studies as the Weltkrieg raged on. He found Japan's highly elitist and militaristic culture unfit for him; instead, Zhou rejected the idea that the Japanese model was sufficient for a country such as China. With the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and Chen Duxiu's New Youth in full swing shortly after - Zhou became firmly committed and sympathetic towards Marxist and leftist ideals. He would travel to France in 1920 alongside the Chinese Work-Study Programme, which included his future wife, Deng Yingchao.\n\nWith news of Sun Yat-sen's revolution reborn in Guangzhou, most nationalistic leftist parties such as the Chinese Syndicalist Party of which Zhou was an affiliate began to work with the Kuomintang. While in Europe, Zhou helped establish the European branch of the Kuomintang, where he fostered proteges such as Nie Rongzhen. In 1924, he returned to China, where he joined Sun's revolution in Guangzhou and helped prepare the National Revolutionary Army as director of political education.\n\n He would then participate in two of the NRA's expeditions before joining the ill-fated Northern Expedition. When the expedition failed, he would flee with much of the Kuomintang Central Committee into Europe. As 1936 dawns, Zhou finds himself sent by the Central Committee ahead of time to assist in revolutionary activities around the League of Eight Provinces and Shanghai.

The school opened in 1924, but at the end of the year, the students of this first-class transferred to China's newest military school - Sun Yat-sen's Whampoa Military Academy. As a first-class member, he made a name for himself after being wounded in the Eastern Expedition against Chen Jiongming.\n\nWith the approval of the school's principal Chiang Kai-shek, Deng took a year off to study at the Commune of France. However, his trip was short-lived as the Northern Expedition had broken out.

His father worked overseas, so he was brought up primarily by his uncle, who sent him to a private school. In 1912, Huang entered the Guangzhou Normal School where he was first exposed to revolutionary ideas. He attended the Baoding Military Academy and served in an artillery regiment of the Frontier Defence Army. Increasingly sympathetic to the ideals of Sun Yat-sen, Huang returned to Guangdong in 1922 and joined the Kuomintang two years later. Huang’s first position in the NRA was commanding a battalion in the campaign against Chen Jiongming’s forces. During the Northern Expedition, Huang served in the Fourth “Iron” Army alongside Ye Ting and Zhang Fakui. Though fighting valiantly, the Fourth Army was eventually routed by the Zhili Clique, and Huang ended up following the KMT leadership into exile. In France, he drew increasingly close to Deng Yanda and became a founding member of the Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang. Huang accompanied Dang back to China in 1932 for the Shanghai Uprising, and when that failed the two escaped to the JiangFu Insurgent Zone to continue the fight.§!\n\n§YNotes: As a close friend and confidant of Deng Yanda, he is a prominent member of the Provisional Action Committee.§!"

After graduation, he served on the cruiser "Hai Rong" and when the Xinhai Revolution broke out he supported the revolutionaries. In 1921, he served as captain of the Yangtze River Patrol and by 1924, he held the title of rear admiral. When the Northern Expedition broke out in 1925, Chen Jiling chose to defect to the National Revolutionary Army. However, the revolution's failure prompted him to follow much of the Central Committee into retreat in Europe. Since he already held the qualifications of an experienced seaman, he naturally found a home in the Union of Britain - where he has been studying the latest in naval tactics and developments with the hope that one day he will be able to bring about the creation of China's own modern fleets."

He instead travelled overseas to the newly proclaimed Commune of France where he met fellow leftists, socialists, and syndicalists such as Cai Hsen, Cai Chang, and Deng Xiaoping. He then participated in the Work-Study Programme where he worked in French factories but in 1921, he left France to study at the Chemical Engineering Department at the Université du Travail in Belgium. During his stay in Belgium, he gradually turned further to the left and joined the Chinese Syndicalist Party.\n\nIn 1924, he joined the Chinese Kuomintang and served as the director of the Kuomintang's communications department in Paris. It was around this time, that he attended the military school in Saint-Cyr and in 1925, he returned to China with French aid and weapons to aid in the Northern Expedition. He served under Zhou Enlai in the Political Department, where he essentially acted as Zhou's protege.
