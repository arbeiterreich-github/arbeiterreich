Despite his lineage, he aligned himself to Dr Sun Yat-sen's cause as a zealous and scholarly revolutionary. After a brief stint in Jiangxi as the province's chairman and a lengthy career in the Kuomintang, Zhu Peide fled into exile after the KMT's failed Northern Expedition. Alongside most of the remaining 3rd NRA army, he returned back to his home region of Yunnan, beginning to build up a new career within Tang Jiyao's administration.\nWhen Tang's government fell, Zhu Peide seized the opportunity to rally the remnants of the Rightist Kuomintang and denounce Long Yun's takeover. Alongside his comrades, he marched west for Kunming and lead a successful takeover. Now comfortably seated in the capital of Yunnan, he has sworn to rebuild a National Government, honouring Sun Yat-sen's legacy."

 YUN_tang_jiyao_leader_desc: "A loyal follower of General Cai E, Tang began his political career in 1911, when Cai E ordered him to take part in the Wuchan Uprising, beginning the Xinhai Revolution. After the success of the revolution, he became governor of Guizhou and would later return to his home province of Yunnan in 1913 to replace Cai E. When Yuan Shikai announced his ambitions of becoming an Emperor, Tang immediately seceded with the support of the likes of Cai E and Li Liejun, who would spearhead the National Protection War alongside Tang. With their victory in the National Protection War, Yunnan became one of the main hegemons of the continent.\nHowever, Yunnan's glory days have long since faded away. Tang led one failed expedition after another, with his failure in defeating Sichuan causing him to almost be deposed by Gu Pinzhen in a coup d'etat in 1921 - thus, the failure of the Northern Expedition became a blessing for Tang's control over Yunnan. While the threat of the Zhili Clique and their German patrons looms in the distance, the presence of the surviving NRA members as well as Tang's own forces has largely deterred them from taking action against a seemingly hostile Republican province. However, Tang's flamboyant and overambitious character have largely alienated many of the officers residing in Yunnan, and his control over the province is much weaker than it seems from the outside."

 YUN_lu_han: "Lu Han"
 YUN_lu_han_leader_desc: "Rumours have long circulated that Lu Han was the alleged half-brother of Long Yun, which is said to have been one of the reasons behind the two men's close comradeship. Whether that is the truth or not, it seems that whatever bond of blood or friendship existed between the two was not thick enough to prevent Lu Han from seizing this latest opportunity. The young Yi general has served with the Kuomintang, fought with the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang of Indochina, and now lead a daring coup against his former comrades. Lu has desperately gathered his forces in the capital and has set out to weather the coming storm. Yet the men around him wonder: can a man who betrayed his own supposed brother really be trusted?"

 YUN_hu_ruoyu: "Hu Ruoyu"
 YUN_hu_ruoyu_leader_desc: "The new administration was not to last, as the men who ousted Tang Jiyao have now turned their knives and guns on each other. Hu Ruoyu has made the first move, making a play to control the capital with the aid of his small band of followers. Unlike his peers, Hu came from a privileged family of scholars and landlords, yet found himself drawn to the revolutionary politics of the early 20th century. Under the patronage of Tang Jiyao, he climbed the ranks of the Yunnanese Army, eventually landing a comfortable position in the Kunming Military staff. With deep pockets and close connections to the officers and garrisons of the capital, Hu has made a risky gamble to oust and arrest his co-conspirators, proclaiming himself as Yunnan's new leader. Now time will tell if that risk will pay off..."

 YUN_long_yun: "Long Yun"
 YUN_long_yun_leader_desc: "In his youth, Long Yun became inspired by the radical Anti-Qing student movements among his peers at the Yunnan Military Academy. He joined a local militia and fought in the Xinhai revolution, climbing through the ranks until he was serving under Tang Jingyu as commander of the Fifth Army, within the Yunnan Clique. His rise to power was helped by the close comradeship he held with his superior, as well as his alleged half-brother Lu Han. Yet in time, these friendships would be tainted with political rivalry and a heated competition for power in the declining revolutionary movement. It has taken many sacrifices, many betrayals and certainly regrets, yet Long Yun has now risen to lead the Yunnan Clique as its new warlord.\nLong's hold over Yunnan is tenuous but determined, he holds plenty of ambitions to remain a leading figurehead for the coming years, yet just like how he ousted his predecessor there's a distinct risk his own subordinates could turn on him at any minute. This is not helped by Long's ethnic background as a member of the Yi minority, although it has helped foster friendships between his administration and his kinsfolk. A pragmatist, an outsider to the Han political elite, and an ambitious warlord: 'The Dragon of Yunnan' may be a force for China to reckon with."

 YUN_zhu_de: "Zhu De"
 YUN_zhu_de_leader_desc: "Famed as a man who rose from humble beginnings, Zhu De was nothing bit a dirt poor peasant, a simple tenant farmer in the Sichuan countryside. At nine years of age, he was taken in by a wealthy uncle and later sent to study at Yunnan Military Academy. His time at the academy saw him enlist in the Tongmenhui, the predecessor to the Kuomintang. The next years in Zhu De's life were a turbulent series of travels throughout China, fighting at various revolutionary fronts with the National Republican Army, serving various political factions and building up a great network of connections. From Sichuan to Shanghai, Tibet and even a brief stint as a student in Berlin, the roads of fate eventually lead Zhu De back to Yunnan. In recent years he fell afoul of the warlord Tang Jiyao's despotism, being driven to resign his position in the National Republican Army and promise to abstain from politics rather than face an umpteenth journey around the Asian continent.\nZhu De had perhaps expected to spend the rest of his life as a teacher at the Yunnan Military Academy, yet the news that Tang's government had fallen, and that all hell was breaking loose in Yunnan convinced him resurface from obscurity. Outwitting and outlasting the failed would-be despots of Yunnan, Zhu has set out with a simple goal, to here in Yunnan build the moral and responsible democratic institutions which he has studied, taught and dreamed of."

 YUN_li_xin: "Li Xin"
 YUN_li_xin_leader_desc: "Li Xin initially attended a German Private school in Kunming, where after he would study at various universities around the country. He first studied agronomy in Nanjing's South Eastern University, but was transferred to Beijing Agriculture University. During his stay in the Northern capital he became increasingly interested by foreign political thought, studying the failed Bolshevik movement in Russia and the now ascendant Syndicalist ideology in Europe. Throughout the '20s he grew increasingly closer to Syndicalism and later with other radical students at the university to form a political group named the "Renovation Society" in order to promote leftist views. After graduating in 1926, he travelled to Guangzhou and attended a lecture held by the Chinese Communist Party and Leftist Kuomintang on Agricultural Socialism. Although Li was at this point enamoured with Syndicalism, he accepted a request from the political representatives to join the Communist Party and help organise a political movement back in his home province of Yunnan. Dubbed the "Yunnan Special Branch", this group was initially meant to collaborate with its superiors but lost contact with the mother party following the failure of the Northern Expedition.\nLi, as one of the key figures in the group began to apply the same ideological currents which had dominated the Renovation Society, building an underground intellectual society of Syndicalist radicals in the heart of Kunming. This lead to a large schism between those loyal to the Special Branch's original beliefs, and Li's Syndicalist influence, eventually leading to Li's party founding 'Xindianshe' or 'The New Society' as a separate group. Despite his revolutionary convictions, Li has managed to remain below the radar of Tang's government. Initially several warlords in Yunnan were aware of his leftist beliefs, but had little reason to persecute a simple agricultural scholar. That all changed when Li Xin journeyed to various Yunnanese tin mines, hoping to organise the workers into a union. He even disguised himself as a miner, toiling away in hopes of growing closer to the proletariat. After organising a wildcat strike in 1929 Li was almost arrested and executed, which forced him to go into hiding. Since then he has continued to grow his political influence, hoping to once more unite the Yunnanese workers and show the warlords what power truly lies in the hands of the proletariat."

 YUN_wang_fusheng: "Wang Fusheng"
 YUN_wang_fusheng_leader_desc: "Wang's life was uneventful until he was admitted to Beijing University's Liberal Arts programme. Early on he began to associate with radical student groups, getting to know several influential figures such as Li Xin and Li Dazhou. While many of his comrades dabbled in studying the newly resurgent Syndicalist movement that was sweeping through Europe and America, Wang remained a committed Marxist. He later joined Li Xin's \"Renovation Society\", a leftist group which promoted socialist ideology at Beijing University. During this time he witnessed many of his comrades be repressed, arrested and even executed by the Beijing government, driving him down a vengeful and authoritarian path. Much like his colleague Li Xin, he met with members of the Chinese Communist Party and Leftist Kuomintang, being similarly instructed to travel back to Yunnan and organise socialists within the province. The hope was to topple the warlord Tang Jiyao's hold over the south west, by founding a 'Yunnan Special Branch' of the Communist Party that could ferment revolution.\nYet the Special Branch was nearly annihilated when the Northern Expedition failed, and its superiors among the CPC and Leftist Kuomintang ended up scattered to the wind. Worst of all for Wang, his own comrades now began to turn on him. Rejecting the old authorities they had followed and beginning to rally around Li Xin's own syndicalist views. Outraged, Wang seized control of the special branch and moved to expel Li. During his tenure as leader of the underground revolutionary society, he worked to regain contact with whatever remnants of the Kuomintang or CPC might still be organised and continuing the fight in China. After years of silence and falls leads, he finally found them. The ZhongTeJu, and through a series of secret meetings, encoded messages and risky plans, the Yunnan Special Branch was restored to its original purpose: To ferment revolution against the Yunnan warlords. Despite his new superiors and the schism with his old comrades, Wang remains diligently committed to one single goal, revolution before all."

 YUN_gong_shou: "Gong Shou"
 YUN_gong_shou_leader_desc: "The latest in a long line of Yi Tusi, a form of regional hereditary chieftain in the old imperial bureaucracy, Gong Shou rose to prominence thanks to his unscrupulous political flexibility and zealous defence of the southern minorities' autonomy. Although initially born with the name Dāo Yuè Chūn, he served as Tusi of the Nandian Prefecture up until the Xinhai Revolution. Sensing political change sweeping through China, Shou changed his name to Gong and began to promote an elaborate story that his family were in reality descendants of Ming dynasty soldiers who had occupied Yunnan. The decision to pass himself off as a member of the Han ethnicity earned Shou a considerable degree of influence in the post-revolutionary political climate, which he used to campaign against the attempted land reforms that would weaken the Yi people and their Tusi's autonomy. Although it landed him a stint in prison, he was later released and continued to live with this unique ethnic duality, spending some days as the Han politician Gong Shou and others as the Yi Chieftain Dao YueChun."

 YUN_jin_handing: "Jin Handing"
 YUN_jin_handing_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §g1887, in Yuxi, Yunnan, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gRenowned as a war hero who distinguished himself during general Cai E's march into Sichuan, Jin Handing once had a bright career ahead of him. In 1922 he was appointed acting governor of Yunnan as part of the leadup to the Northern Expedition. After a mere month in office Jin was pressured to resign by Tang Jiyao in a political soft coup. Having lost his prestigious position in Yunnan, he attached himself to Chiang Kai Chek's forces, but the Kuomintang's failed military campaign put another stop to Jin's ambitions. Facing obscurity or exile, the young commander was surprised to see his usurper, Tang Jiyao extend an olive branch after the Manchu Restoration and invite him back to Kunming. With a desperate need for competent, republican generals, Jin and Tang have to overlook their mutual distaste for each other and prepare for the inevitable confrontation with their northern enemy. As the democratic forces lick their found, Jin has also had the chance to reunite with some old friends, such as his former classmate Zhu De. In addition to his military work, Jin Handing is also a renowned teetotaller, leading a political campaign against the mass consumption of tobacco, opium and alcohol within the National Republican Army."

 YUN_luo_binghui: "Luo Binghui"
 YUN_luo_binghui_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gDecember 12th, 1897, in Zhaotong, Yunnan, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gThe son of destitute farmers, Luo was infamous from an early age after developing a furious hatred of landlords, oppressors and capitalists. Despite this unruly nature, he joined the military and became a renowned and obedient soldier. During this time, he was noticed by Tang Jiyao and promoted to a higher position, climbing the ranks through the National Republican Army until he had the honour of serving as Dr Sun Yat-sen's bodyguard. During the Northern Expedition, he was wounded in combat and hospitalised, an event that likely saved his life during the disastrous military campaign. After recovering, he joined his exiled comrades in Yunnan, making use of his friendship with Tang to easily join the warlord's inner circle of confidants."

 YUN_fan_shisheng_commander_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §g1891, in Yuxi, Yunnan, Qing Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gAs opposed to most members of the Yunnan Clique, Fan Shisheng did not initially come from a military background. He studied medicine and worked as a teacher, until his friend Li Hongxiang introduced him to general Cai E. Already enamoured with the revolutionary movement, Fan abandoned his academic career and joined Cai's army. The constant struggles and repeated failures of the Kuomintang to consolidate their hold over China eventually lead Fan to retire from the military, taking up work as a doctor in Kunming. He was content to remain as an apolitical civilian, until he caught Tang Jiyao's attention. Already familiar with each other from their time in the revolution, Tang managed to convince his old comrade to return to the army. Fan has now traded in his robes and rickshaw for a uniform and rifle, attaching himself to the recovering republican movement."

 YUN_zhao_xingwu: "Zhao Xingwu"
 YUN_zhao_xingwu_leader_desc: "Zhao travelled to Kunming and attended Yunnan Law School in 1917. Although he was too young to participate in the Xinhai Revolution or the National Protection War, the stories of what was happening around China thrilled him. During his stay in Kunming he began reading political literature, both the more mainstream democratic manifestos but also digging into forbidden communist propaganda that had been outlawed under the warlord Tang Jiyao's rule. After attempting to organise political activities among his fellow students, he was expelled from the school. Outraged at this censorship, Zhao decided to leave Yunnan and join the Kuomintang's armies to the east. During the coming military campaigns he served as an officer under Zhu Peide, distinguishing himself thanks to his analytical mind and aptitude for strategic thinking. It was also around this time he first joined the Communist Party of China, but his hopes of working with fellow socialists both within the party and the Kuomintang was short lived. The failure of the Northern Expedition broke the democratic and socialist movements in southern China, forcing Zhao to flee back to Yunnan alongside his superior Zhu Peide. During his exile, he distanced himself from both the other rightist Kuomintang exiles. He began to correspond and meet with various members of the now scattered leftists, becoming a key liaison to them in Yunnan. Zhao has gone from leading students, soldiers and now exiles, but despite it all he still maintains a great skill for leadership and a zealous devotion to socialist ideals."

Instead, he worked as a teacher and military educator. Like many of his comrades, he fled to Yunnan when news arrived of Chiang Kai Chek's death.
