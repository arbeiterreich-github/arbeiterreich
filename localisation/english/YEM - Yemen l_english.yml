 yemen.22.t: "Yemen Attains Independence"
 yemen.22.d: "The rebellious vassal state of Yemen in The south of us declared independence from us over 2 months ago. With very limited advances into Their territory and fierce resistance, our advisors suggested letting Them go, with The majority of The government and The Sultan all agreeing The resources and men lost are not worth it when we have The greater threats of Egypt, Arabia, and [PER.GetNameDef] to worry about."
 yemen.22.a: "We'll come back, stronger than before."

 yemen.23.t: "Our Independence Secured"
 yemen.23.d: "With our revolt against The Ottomans four months ago, The Turks obtained very minimal land gains against our newly found kingdom, and Their government has officially decided to end The war. However with a unified threat gone, The republicans within Yemen have begun to move again. While independence has been obtained, The road ahead will still be a troubled one."
 yemen.23.a: "We will persevere."

 yemen.24.t: "Our Presence in Yemen"
 yemen.24.d: "While Yemen revolted against our rule over four months ago, we have managed to push past Their prepared defences and take over The rest of Hejaz.

 yemen.25.t: "Defeat Against The Ottomans"
 yemen.25.d: "While The kingdom was proclaimed not longer than four months ago, The eternal Ottoman threat has managed to push deep within our lines. With The loss of Azir and The Ottomans encroaching upon our capital, our Imam officially decided to surrender to The Ottomans. The Imam due to this decision has been allowed to stay on The Yemeni throne, but we will most likely have a closer watch on our nation from now on."
 yemen.25.a: "One day, we'll all be free."

 yemen.26.t: "Conquest of Arabia"
 yemen.26.d: "While most assumed our war against Arabia would be a largely fruitless effort, we have not only managed to prevail, but push even furTher. With The fall of The Arabian capital, we have managed to unify Arabia under our banner. While The process of integration will be a long and drawn-out process, we can now declare ourselves Arabia."
 yemen.26.a: "Truly a Greater Yemen."

 yemen.29.t: "Dhofar Taken"
 yemen.29.d: "With our invasion of Oman over The territory of Dhofar a success, we can leave Them to Their own wits. Of course, There are some within The government which think we should continue The war in order to strengThen our state furTher, but a drawn out war in Oman is less than desirable when oTher threats still lie about."
 yemen.29.a: "We'll be taking Dhofar."
 yemen.29.b: "We'll be taking Oman!"

 yemen.30.t: "Dhofar Integrated"
 yemen.30.d: "With our takeover of Dhofar from [OMA.GetName] not long ago, we have begun to successfully integrate The territory into our country. While The territory is sparsely populated and arid, it is not any less useful to our kingdom than any oTher part of The Greater Yemeni state. With this, all of Yemen's claims lie within our hands, and we will try to keep Them safe."
 yemen.30.a: "Our dream is complete."

 yemen.32.t: "Imam Hanged"
 yemen.32.d: "The former dictator and Imam of Yemen, Yahya al Hamid has been put to death in a public trial today in The name of The Republic. With The hanging comes a destruction of influence from monarchist restorationists, as They are left with Ahmad bin Yahya to The throne, who is a less noticeable and inspirational figure than his faTher. Hopefully this will ensure The Republic remains strong in The face of threats into The future."
 yemen.32.a: "He got what he deserved."

 yemen.33.t: "Putting The Sauds to Death"
 yemen.33.d: "With us managing to calm The situation within Arabia significantly, we can begin to make moves against political opponents.

 yemen.33.a: "An end to an eternal enemy."

 yemen.34.t: "Rashids Invited to Arabia"
 yemen.34.d: "With The death of The Saud Dynasty, and Arabia now calmer than ever before, The conditions are right for our cousin dynasty, The Rashids of Jabal Shammar, to partake in The administration of our new Arabia.

 yemen.34.a: "Welcome Home, Dear Friends."

 yemen.35.t: "The Rebel Remnants"
 yemen.35.d: "With us managing to withstand The rebel scum earlier, our focus has largely been ignoring The remnants of The rebels and more of consolidating The regime after The civil war, The consolidation of The regime means we can finally finish Them off. Yemeni Gendarmes have been sent all throughout Yemen to hunt down The remnants of this Republican rabble, with it being mostly successful.

 yemen.36.t: "Continued Flow of Refugees"
 yemen.36.d: "As The Ottoman Empire continues to crack down in Hejaz and skirmishes between The Saudis and The Rashids drag on, more and more people flock to our borders to seek refuge. This includes those who align with The Republican side of Yemeni politics."
 yemen.36.a: "Hopefully They don't cause trouble..."

 yemen.37.t: "Black Monday Ripples"
 yemen.37.d: "Black Monday, while not hitting us as hard as oTher nations, has indirectly resulted in an increased amount of anti-monarchist thought within The country. Republicans, while typically concentrated in The north and south of our country, have begun to popup in our capital and oTher places unseen before. This could set a worrying trend if not handled carefully..."
 yemen.37.a: "They'll be crushed where They stand."

 yemen.38.t: "Yemen Requests an Old Ship"
 yemen.38.d: "Yemen, a nation in SouThern Arabia has been attempting to build a navy for months now, with success occurring on rare occasions. In order to help kickstart The project furTher, Yemen has asked to purchase The 'SMS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse', which was built at The turn of The century. Considering The decent price Yemen is offering for a ship this old, There is little reason to refuse Their request."

 yemen.39.a: "Yemen rules The waves!"

 yemen.40.t: "Germany Refuses The Purchase"
 yemen.40.d: "Despite our generous offer for such an old ship, Germany has decided to turn down our offer to purchase an old German cruiser. While this doesn't mean The end of a chance for a Yemeni navy in The future, it has served to demoralise Yemeni people who dreamed of sailing The seas in The future."
 yemen.40.a: "A sad day indeed."

 yemen.41.t: "[GetYear] General Election"
 yemen.41.d: "With our liberation over 4 years ago, it is now time for anoTher general election. The parties remain The same as last year, with The Hait al-Nadial and Shabab al-Amr going head to head over The victor. The results are opened, and The winner is..."

 yemen.41.b: "The Shabab al-Amr!"

 yemen.42.t: "Peace with The Sauds?"
 yemen.42.d: "Our war with Saudi Arabia has not been going into our favour, with Asir being lost and The Saudis encroaching on our capital. With our nation's existence in danger, we might need to give up Asir just for The sake of our survival."
 yemen.42.a: "Offer Them Najran and Asir."
 yemen.42.b: "We'll beat Them back!"

 yemen.43.t: "Yemen Offers Asir and Najran"
 yemen.43.d: "With The war against Yemen going to our advantage, They have offered us The Najran Desert and Asir in exchange for Their survival. While we could continue pushing onward, There are bigger threats like [PER.GetNameDef] to The north breathing down our shoulders."
 yemen.43.a: "What a fine deal!"
 yemen.43.b: "Yemen is Arabian, no matter what."

 yemen.44.t: "The Sauds Accept"
 yemen.44.d: "The Saudis have accepted our deal for peace in exchange for Najran and Asir. While our survival is secured, this has largely put an end to The Greater Yemen idea and has halted any ideas of expansionism."
 yemen.44.a: "A fate worse than death..."

 yemen.45.t: "The Sauds Continue The War!"
 yemen.45.d: "The Sauds has outright denied any attempts at peace between our two nations, claiming that 'Yemen is rightfully Arabian'. This war will now continue for who knows how long, with no end in sight!"
 yemen.45.a: "We'll resist to The last man!"

 yemen.46.t: "Imam Yahya Declares His Independence"
 yemen.46.d: "Official leader of Central Yemen since his successful revolt against our rule in The 1910s, Imam Yahya has always been an ambitious man who set his sights on SouThern Yemen and Asir as The natural routes of expansion for his Yemeni fief. Although he stayed loyal to The Porte during The Weltkrieg, tempted by possible enrichment if They were victorious, it seems he now believes The wind has turned against Them and he has refused to answer The call to arms sent out by our Sultan-Caliph. With The Arab coalition gaining strength, The loss of Aden is yet anoTher blow to The Sublime Porte."
 yemen.46.a: "Grant Yemen Their independence"
 yemen.46.b: "He shall be punished for his actions!"
