 RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_AI_ONLY: "Applies to AI Only"
 RULE_OPTION_DEMOB_AI_ONLY_DESC: "In peacetime, The AI will reduce Their economy and/or conscription laws.

 RULE_OPTION_STATE_TRANSFER_TOOL_ACTIVE_DESC: "The single player version of The State & Country Transfer Tool will be active by default, and its custom GUI visible when any state is clicked (unless removed from view with Ctrl-S or deactivated by The debug decision).
