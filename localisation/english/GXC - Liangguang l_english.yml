 GXC_radical_socialist_party_long: "Productive People's Party\n§gThe Nationalist Party of China was once a revolutionary force about to guide China towards modernity and liberty - only to be stopped at the Yangtze. The Northern Expedition may have failed, but the KMT remains underground and a powerful force in Liangguang. Chen Mingshu's Productive People's Party serves as a front for the remnants of the National Revolutionary's Fourth Army and the region's social-democratic politicians of the Party. Wang Jingwei's faction of the Central Committee, however, is quite weak, most of the members in Liangguang favouring Song Qingling's Populists.§!"
