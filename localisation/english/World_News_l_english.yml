 worldnews.195.d.republic: "In an astonishing sequence of events by Dutch standards, Queen Wilhelmina has abdicated The throne after half a century of rule. Appalled by The rise of The syndicalist RSAP and The breakdown of moderate consensus in her nation in The wake of The failure of The previous government, Queen Wilhelmina is seemingly unwilling to continue her rule.\n\nIn farcical scenes in Parliament, Colijn's and The ruling government's efforts to push through legislation financing The coronation of Princess Julia were blocked by The Leftist RSAP and SDAP. As a result The monarchy has ended up being abolished, and a new socialist Republic formed."

Dismayed by The victory of The Left-Links electoral pact, Wilhelmina had boldly stated that she would only accept The moderate VDB's candidate as Formateur, Pieter Oud, despite The SDAP's victory - forcing Them instead to ally with The socialist RSAP. With even moderate Parliamentarians furious at her inadvertently forcing The SDAP to The left, Queen Wilhelmina's position quickly became untenable, and The SDAP's Willem Albarda was appointed.\n\nWith The abdication of The monarch, The Leftists that now run The nation have declared The creation of a Dutch Republic \"free from reactionary tyranny\"."

Despite The city's international protections, The victory came somewhat easily, as Shanghai's police forces and limited garrison could put up little resistance against a real army. The general population barely resisted, and Their non-cooperation cannot have aided The already bare-bones defences.\n\nThe international city's future now seems unclear, as its prosperity has always been built on The backs of trade and foreign investment. Uncertainty reigns, and The futures of The city's foreign residents are also in doubt."

 worldnews.470.d.wk2: "After two decades of plotting their homecoming, the French exiles in Algeria have decided to seize the initiative and take advantage of the ongoing Weltkrieg by declaring war against the member countries of the Third Internationale.\n\nWith the revolutionary alliance busy fighting Germany, the forces of the Entente believe they now have a chance to return home and crush the revolutions that ousted them once and for all. Despite the Entente's rhetoric, whether or not the old imperial powers will be able to even land on their mainlands is an open question, and depends in large part on their old German foe's luck and generosity."
 worldnews.470.d.before_wk2: "While, nominally, the world has been largely at peace since the British Revolution of 1925, the truth is that a war had been left to wait. Following the Great War, the revolutions in Britain, France, and Italy did not destroy their old governments, but merely sent them overseas, preparing for a final confrontation ever since.\n\nThat confrontation seems at hand. Mere hours ago, the Marine National's Mediterranean patrols suddenly changed their bearings - directly towards Communard waters. While maritime standoffs between the French governments aren't unheard of, the approaching vessels are making no attempt to change course. Already, Communard forces have been placed on high alert, aware that their war is no longer waiting."

 worldnews.471.d.wk2: "After the end of the British revolution, the new Syndicalist government in London found itself staring down the old government-in-exile in Ottawa across the Atlantic for a decade and a half, neither side particularly willing nor able to break the tense peace which followed.\n\nToday this strange status quo has finally collapsed, as the Canadian government declared that they shall wait no longer to \"continue the struggle\". Reports of large mobilisations and aggressive naval actions, along with rumours of coordination with the Reichspakt, all seem to confirm that Canada has thrown herself and her allies into the Second Weltkrieg."

Following the Great War, the revolutions in Britain, France, and Italy did not destroy their old governments, but merely sent them overseas, preparing for a final confrontation ever since.\n\nThat confrontation seems at hand. Earlier today, Canadian warships began forcibly seizing a number British merchant vessels crossing the Atlantic, in what seems like a coordinated move. While posturing between the two navies is known to happen, this time it seems that the Royal Navy is not withdrawing - and instead moving with intent towards Republican waters. The Republican Navy has responded in kind: their war is no longer waiting."

This colony's very existence now seems to be in jeopardy, however, as what German authorities previously described as a small-scale, dying conflict has violently erupted into war.\n\nIn Kenya, a coalition of several different ethnicities have banded together in an insurgency to expel European settlers from the land. In response, [MAF.GetLeader], the head of the colony, has sworn to \"restore order\" as [MAF.GetAdjective] units set off for war."

Now, though, this status-quo threatens to shatter as [JAP.GetNameDef] and [GER.GetNameDef] go to war.\n\nDespite hopes for peace, many have seen this turn of events as inevitable. Japanese plans for an Asia centred around itself were always incompatible with German domination in the region, and with the West engulfed in crisis, Tokyo's leaders doubted whether another chance to realise these ambitions may appear. Whichever side fortune may favour, one thing is for certain - Asia's future hangs in the balance."

 worldnews.475.d: "Following Zhang Zhuolin's conquest of Beijing, China's Fengtian Government seemed poised to reunite the country, but today, these expectations lie shattered. The \"Old Marshal\", as Zuolin was commonly known, was struck down by an assassin in Shenyang. Mere hours after his death, officers under Yang Yuting led a coup d'etat with Japanese support and ousted forces loyal to Zhang Xueliang, the Old Marshal's son.\n\nYuting's new regime has already taken a pro-Japanese stance, allowing Tokyo's corporations near unlimited access to the country's vast resources and the IJA to assist in \"keeping order\". To many, it seems that China has become little more than a Japanese protectorate."

 worldnews.477.d: "For 12 years, the province of Shandong has been ruled by Zhang Zongchang, a man once dubbed China's \"basest\" warlord, for his corruption and extravagance unusually high even by Chinese standards. Now, though, this situation has come to an unexpectedly sudden end. In the early hours of the morning, a contingent of Qing Infantry, apparently requested by [SQI.GetLeader], entered Jinan and stormed Zongchang's home, taking him to Beijing in handcuffs to await trial for his crimes.\n\n[SQI.GetLeader] has consequently been appointed the new Governor of Shandong.

Following the failure of the government to crack down on the nation's nascent Syndicalist movement, conservative officers conducted a coup d'etat, ousting the Prime Minister and establishing a military dictatorship. But even this has proven temporary - officers aligned with the rival Restorationist faction have launched a counter-coup.\n\nAs the streets of Asia's greatest city run red with blood, they have announced the Shōwa Restoration - a restoration of ultimate power to the Emperor, and the rebirth of Japan, free from the corrupting influences of Syndicalism, democracy, and Western influence."

Ultimately, it seems, their efforts were for nought - troops loyal to the government were able to launch a counter-coup and successfully crush the rebels.\n\nYet, this episode has shown without a doubt the parties' weakness.
